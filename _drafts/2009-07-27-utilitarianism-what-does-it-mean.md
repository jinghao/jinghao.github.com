Unless you like to see others suffer, you will agree with me that a world in which everyone else is weakly better off is a weakly better world, even if you stand to benefit at no point in the picture. That's what utilitarianism is--compassion for the welfare of others even though conventional economic theory would suggest indifference. It doesn't always mean sacrificing yourself for the collective good of everyone else. That would be unreasonable to ask of most people, even though if everyone "sacrificed" some part of themselves for the good of everyone else, everyone can be better off. That is why we need a referee, someone to do the handshakes to ensure that everyone is better off.
