While Giuliani and Huckabee dropped out of the Republican race, leaving Senator McCain as the only viable Republican candidate, Clinton and Obama, who are already duking it out to the last breath, must accept another dilution of party-base votes (Gee, thanks, Nader). If it weren't for the war and all the other crap in which the Republicans got themselves trapped in the past administration, the election would have been called already.
