If I intend to accomplish anything this summer, I need to make it into a list:
<ol>
<li>Complete all of my work items and commitments and perform beyond expectations</li>
<li>Interact with other teams at Microsoft to see where I might be interested in working should I return (and get a return offer)--Windows Mobile, XBox (the Entertainment division in general), Internet Explorer (just because I want to make it better), and even Microsoft Shuttle Service (their assignment algorithm sucks) are on my list so far</li>
<li>Complete my Facebook application (40%)</li>
<li>Complete/pass all of the Facebook puzzles (5%)</li>
<li>Read through the 1000 page corporate finance textbook (10%)</li>
<li><div onclick="this.innerHTML='Complete Pokemon Ruby (Need to find Latios!)'">If you click here, the world will explode</div> (99%)</li>
<li>Swim at least twice a week (100% so far)</li>
<li>Get my bike fixed. (100%)</li>
<li>At the end of the summer, update my resume</li>
</ol>
Things I will work on in the summer:
<ol>
<li><em>Sharpen</em> (ahem) my C sharp skills: Build some useful windows form applications</li>
<li>Learn ASP.NET -- should not be too difficult given #1</li>
<li>Learn to cook more things, cook them better and more efficiently</li>
<li>Read at least half of the books I've received in my first three weeks. That would be two of four</li>
<li>Renovate originxt.com</li>
<li>Reclaim all of my 2008 losses from the stock market (Ha, yeah right)</li>
</ol>
Hopefully I achieve all of the first list, and do a fair share of what I can from the second list.
