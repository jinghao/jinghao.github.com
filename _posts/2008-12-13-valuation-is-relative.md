Frank Beck, the Chief Investment Manager of Capital Financial Group, suggests on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/finance/2008/12/09/dollar-devaluation-gold-pf-ii-in_fb_1209soapbox_inl.html">on Forbes.com</a> that "world currencies should be devalued overnight" because "currency devaluation proved effective in ending the Great Depression," citing numerous benefits such as improved business profit, higher wages, higher equity-to-debt value (for houses and other fixed assets) and lower real national debt.

But wait, how can you devalue world currencies? If you devalue the dollar relative to the British Pound, you are pushing up the value of the pound relative to the dollar. If Mr. Beck is suggesting that all countries print out massive amounts money to "devalue" their currencies relative to some shared commodity such as gold, that's called creating inflation and the solution is only temporary.

His suggestions that his "plan" will improve business profit, raise wages and lower national debt are absolutely ridiculous. That's like the government announcing tomorrow: "All your money is worth twice as much as it was worth yesterday, all your money except the national debt that you guys hold, of course."
