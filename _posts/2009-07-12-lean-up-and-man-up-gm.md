Fritz Henderson, GM's CEO, explains that it is "very painful" to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/business/11auto.html">ask 400 executives to resign or retire</a> because GM doesn't "have a lot of bad executives."

Riight. Apparently it's okay to fire tens of thousands of workers, but having to retire 400 executives who arguably drove the old GM to the ground is painful.
