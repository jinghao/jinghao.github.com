Recently details about [Google's response to Facebook surfaced](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/29/googles-response-to-facebook-maka-maka/), much to the chagrin of the Internet giant, leading us to wonder--is Facebook doomed? Google's immense cache of information about us and its incredible ability to sort through and analyze that digital archive will give it quite an advantage over Facebook when it comes to information-amassing.

As Internet users and everyday clients, what do you think about a potential future GoogleBook (nicknamed the Maka-Maka, which strangely sounds like the familiar open-source information-sharing software Wiki-Wiki)? Keeping in mind the fact that Google has dominated almost every market it has entered into (Search and advertising, most prominently) and had an opportunity to mature in (that is, minus GMail), do you believe that Google's entry into the social-networking scene spell the end to Facebook, or do you believe it will appeal to a different sector/market than Facebook? And perhaps more importantly, would you use Google's new network?
