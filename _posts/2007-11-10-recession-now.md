That was a nice joke. Tell that to Google, Intel, Sandisk, Apple, Microsoft, NVidia, HP, Cisco, SunPower, VMWare/EMC, Oracle, IBM, or even Facebook. They'll get some good laughs too. They're earning more money now than ever, and their projections place their collective growth at a comfortable pace, so why is the media <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/opinion/10herbert.html" target="_blank">so worried about a supposedly oncoming recession?</a>

Columnist Bob Herbert quotes Sen. Charles Schumer (That guy again), who bases his diagnosis that "we are at a moment of economic crisis" on "falling housing prices, lack of confidence in creditworthiness, the weak dollar and high oil prices." Yet, despite the credit and price pressures, <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/productivity-rises-49-fastest-pace/story.aspx?guid=%7B8C7148CA-9BF4-491D-B8FB-A69F413860C4%7D" target="_blank">the US economy grew at a brisk 4.3% in the third quarter of 2007.</a> Its ability to withstand the otherwise-deadly combination underlines the resilience and strength of the US economy, not its weakness. Senators who aren't well-versed in the simple principles of economics should leave that job to those who are paid to analyze the economy--the Federal Reserve board.

Yet, the unversed journalist (Herbert) argues that "while Mr. Bernanke and others are waiting for the official diagnosis (a decline in the gross domestic product for two successive quarters), the disease [of economic recession] is spreading and has been spreading for some time," claiming that "the evidence is all around us." For "evidence", he curiously (and ignorantly) he cites the "housing meltdown", the trouble in the auto industry, the "weak" job market, and the rising price of energy and food--all of which are absolutely irrelevant to how fast the economy expanded. The rising rate of foreclosures is due to the financial irresponsibility of the individuals involved; the troubles in the auto industry is an issue contained in a single sector; the "weak" job market assertion is an absolute lie; and the cost per unit of energy and food is a result an enormous jump in global demand, which is caused by economic <em>growth</em>, NOT recession. To top it all off, he asserts that "only the people still trapped in denial could have believed otherwise"--as if he knew better than a panel of economists.

He seems to have forgotten that <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/productivity-rises-49-fastest-pace/story.aspx?guid=%7B8C7148CA-9BF4-491D-B8FB-A69F413860C4%7D" target="_blank">productivity rose at "the fastest pace in four years" last quarter--a stunning 4.9%</a>--and that the weaker dollar has not triggered inflation in core commodities but instead has <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21707734/" target="_blank">pushed exports to "new highs for a seventh consecutive month."</a>

Given the immense resilience and strength the American economy has shown (and continues to show) against all the economic obstacles, I don't believe it is headed for a recession. Do you?
