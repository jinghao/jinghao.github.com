The guy who tested positive for TB but flew across the Atlantic from Europe through Canada to the States despite strict orders from his doctors not to? Yeah, that guy. How is he any less blameworthy than the people who [delivered HIV to us](http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-10-30-voa66.cfm)? Unfortunately, the culprit probably died a long time ago already.

The US needs better disease-control mechanisms at its borders.
