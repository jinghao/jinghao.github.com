Yup, [my last post involving my grandmother](node/111) can be described as an understatement. Apparently I only have three living grandparents now. Shoot.

Me: so uh, my grandma's dead
Joey: aw she didn't even get to see [your son](node/103)
Joey: why are you so slow?

I think I would be less disappointed if it were a natural death from old age. Instead, some irrational (or, more likely, preoccupied) driver rammed into her and dashed off like a wimp. So now we're tens of thousands of Yuans in debt because of funeral costs and paperwork... And my cousins are paying for most of it, although I know they probably don't have much money to spare. Where's [LFC](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=lfc) when you need it?
