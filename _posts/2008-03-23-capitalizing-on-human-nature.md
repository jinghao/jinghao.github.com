A month ago, Benjamin Lovell, a New York man "who discovered that millions of dollars had mysteriously appeared in his bank account" was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN2137360620080222" rel="external">arrested</a>; for his "crime," he is now being held on $3 million bail and "faces up to 25 years behind bars."

Just half a week ago, police began deliberating over whether to issue charges to those who took advantage of a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN2041413420080320" rel="external">malfunctioning ATM</a> (it "began spewing out double the money Tuesday afternoon and continued doing so for several hours").

Really, are these really the faults of those that I can describe only as opportunistic? Should they be implicated for taking advantage of errors they did not cause? Shouldn't it be the bankers' and the bankers' programmers' faults? Shouldn't they be responsible for this and not simply human nature?
