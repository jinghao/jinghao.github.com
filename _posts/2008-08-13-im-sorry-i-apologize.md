My professor was going over the nuances of "bad news" wording, and he explained the nuances between being sorry, apologizing, and regretting something:

He asked us to compare the following:
<ol>
<li><em>I'm sorry that your grandmother died</em>: Correct</li>
<li><em>I apologize that your grandmother died</em>: Not really, unless you killed her and feel bad about it</li>
<li><em>I regret that your grandmother died</em>: Not unless you actually knew her</li>
</ol>
The second one made me laugh.
