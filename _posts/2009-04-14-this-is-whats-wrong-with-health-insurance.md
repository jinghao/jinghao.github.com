An FML entry tells it all: "Today, I had horrible pains in my stomache area so I went to the doctors. They couldn't find anything wrong and sent me to the Emergency Room for X-rays. After spending the entire day in the hospital, they tell me I'm slightly constipated. I had to pay $400 to find out I had to take a shit. FML"

People go to the hospital and use the emergency room for the dumbest things. This is why our health system is overtaxed (in the non-IRS variant of the word's meaning) and why Americans pay over twice more than what the Japanese pay per capita on health, yet are less healthy.
