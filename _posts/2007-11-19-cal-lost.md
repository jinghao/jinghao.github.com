...five of the last six games. So what?

I came here not for the football team or sports in general. I came here for the EECS and, to an extent, the UGBA programs. I came here for the large-campus experience. I came here for the beautiful campus. I came here for the name. I came here for the scholarship (and the public-education cost). But I did not come here for sports. I'm sure many others shared similar motivations--so why is there such a big fuss over our sucking at football this season? Does it matter? Should universities be judged by the (non)performance of their football teams?
