So three years ago, when I took the [Myer-Briggs personality test](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm), I was an ISTJ, very strongly on all but the last. Now, my diagnosed personality has changed quite noticeably. According to the results page, I am (old -> new):
<ul>
<li>I: slightly expressed introvert (~90% -> <strong>22%</strong>)</li>
<li>N: very expressed intuitive personality (~-80% -> <strong>88%</strong>)</li>
<li>T: distinctively expressed thinking personality (~80% -> <strong>69%</strong>)</li>
<li>J: moderately expressed judging personality (~35% -> <strong>40%</strong>)</li>
</ul>
According to the [supplementary link provided by the site](http://keirsey.com/handler.aspx?s=keirsey&f=fourtemps&tab=5&c=mastermind), INTJs are characterized/recognized by their tendency "to be much more self-confident than the rest, having, for obscure reasons, developed a very strong will." According to the same link, "they are rather rare, comprising no more than, say, one percent of the population."

Yeah, now I'm the one wondering how I can be both N and T at the same time. How did you answer that, Joey, when I asked you? :P
