AIG describes commodities as "an asset class which has returns that have historically been comparable to stock returns but with lower volatility."

Interesting that they would think that holding an iron bar for 20 years is a better investment (comparable returns but with less risk) than holding a few shares of Microsoft, IBM or Pfizer for 20 years. What happens in those 20 years? The iron bar rusts and corrodes while Microsoft, IBM, and Pfizer are earning money for you, the shareholder, and paying out dividends.

AIG, I don't know how you got up there in the first place, but you sure don't deserve a loan from us. It's only offered because we feel sorry for the gullible employees who got swayed by the clueless executives into a mindless trap.
