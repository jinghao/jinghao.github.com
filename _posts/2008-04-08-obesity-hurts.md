As America becomes ever more obese, American Medical Response, which operates 4,200 ambulances worldwide, is forced to finance expensive upgrades to its fleet that cost [57% more than their normal counterparts](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/health/08ambu.html) to accommodate America's growing waistline. So that is why America pays more for health care than any other industrialized nation yet get less from it than many other developed countries--we're fat and cost more to maintain.
