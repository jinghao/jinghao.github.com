According to [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSWEL27805820071212?feedType=nl&feedName=ustechnology), a 17-year-old Australian woman sent a 31-year old man "an enticing text message offering him an early Christmas present in the shape of two friendly women and suggested he take off his clothes to save time"; the man "wasted no time in arriving at the house, and took off his clothes and threw them through the window before entering." Unfortunately, "it was the wrong house and the householder did not see the funny side--the police were called and the man arrested for being unlawfully on a property."

And here I thought miniature train sets were creative Christmas presents :(
