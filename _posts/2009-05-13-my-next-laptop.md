Technology advances fast. My next laptop (which I foresee in my hands around the time of graduation) must have the following (or better, depending on technology and price):

1. Solid state drive for silence, energy-efficiency, durability, cool operation and speed
1. DDR3 memory
1. LED backlight for power-efficiency and contrast
1. Tablet functionality. No more paper!
1. Graphics functionality good enough to run Sims 3 :P
1. Low-voltage CPU--hopefully one that keeps the fan off 99% of the time

... in addition to the basic features like CD/DVD drive (burner), USB ports, wireless chipset, and multi-card reader (for SD cards and stuff). Let's see how many of the above I actually get, and how many of them become superseded by more advanced (perhaps cheaper and more efficient) technology.
