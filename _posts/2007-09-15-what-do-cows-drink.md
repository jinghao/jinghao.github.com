This question can be found in many lateral thinking books.  It's perfect for tricking unsuspecting people.  But you can't trick me! 

Book: What do cows drink?

Me: Milk! 

Book: Of course they don't drink milk. It's water!  Tricked you! 

Me: Erm... then what do calves drink?  It's water and milk! So I'm technically correct! 

So now let me introduce myself, Tricia, the newest columnist, and a self-proclaimed cow expert (who also seems to chat with books).  I am currently a freshman at the University of Berkeley, Cow.  And I have lots of wonderful Cow-info to tell you, but unfortunately I have to spend some more time in deep conversation with my books (aka studying for midterms).  But before I leave, Jinghao has asked me to draw a  picture of a cow, but I have no idea how to post a picture.  So here is an ascii cow for your enjoyment. :)
