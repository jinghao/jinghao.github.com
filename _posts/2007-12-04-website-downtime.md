According to a <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/?p=116" rel="external">table</a> of "downtime in 2007 for the Alexa top 20 websites", Yahoo was down for 0 minutes, Google for seven, Ebay for six, and Youtube for five hours. That's interesting. I've never seen any of those sites down, especially Google.
