When I returned home today, I had a pile of mail waiting to be read. One of them looked particularly interesting because of the nicely-decorated envelope. But before I finished reading the first line, I became disgusted by the letter. Here's the first paragraph:
<blockquote>Congratulations. Based on Jinghao's <i>outstanding achievements</i><sup>1</sup>, <i>they have</i><sup>2</sup> been invited to become a member of America's Future Leaders, a nationwide, non-profit organization devoted to recognizing the academic achievements of America's youth. Jinghao's hard work has placed your child among a select group of students<i>,</i><sup>3</sup> and has earned Jinghao this opportunity to join other distinguished <i>high school</i><sup>4</sup> leaders and be recognized for <i>their</i><sup>2</sup> dedication to excellence.</blockquote>
How can you tell that something is a scam? If it doesn't look professionally written. I have several problems with the opening alone. Here are some:
<ol>
<li>What achievements?</li>
<li>Right, because I'm multiple people, right?</li>
<li>Comma is not necessary when two clauses unambiguously share a common subject.</li>
<li>I'm not in high school anymore, idiot.</li>
</ol>
Have you gotten something like this? How do they get this list of emails of students they believe are "successful" and "hard-working"?
