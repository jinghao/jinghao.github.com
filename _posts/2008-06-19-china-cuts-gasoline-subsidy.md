The price of gasoline, which has been strongly capped in the country, [rose 18%](http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSL1981976320080619) in response to a partial-relaxation of the price cap that has hindered the country's shift away from oil-based energy. Perhaps this will stifle demand and cause the record oil prices to recede to more-manageable levels, such as 60 dollars a barrel. This is a good first step, China. The next logical step is to eliminate the gasoline price cap completely, and then to introduce a per-Yuan tax on gasoline.
