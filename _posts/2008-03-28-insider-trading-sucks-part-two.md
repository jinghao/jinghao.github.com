<a href="http://dailycow.org/node/52">My last article about insider trading</a> focused on the ethical implications of financially rewarding with hundreds of millions of dollars the primary perpetrators of the sub-prime credit crisis that brought down this economy to its knees. This will focus primarily on an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/business/28bear.html" rel="external">influential individual</a> who seeks our sympathies for the tragedies he caused.

Despite bringing about the collapse of a multi-billion dollar firm that has never before reported a loss by steering the company into risky territories, James E. Cayne (who looks like Mozilo), the chairman of Bear Stearns, was able to depart with 61 million dollars from stock sales and much more (in cash) from bonuses and other sources of yearly compensation. With the money he has dutifully collected from BSC since 1969, he bought a 26 million dollar apartment this month. As the New York Times article put it, "he has certainly accumulated enough to live out his retirement years in comfort."

I will make my conclusion quick: he does not deserve such a reward for running a traditionally-profitable firm into the ground and helping throw the American financial system into utter turmoil. This is a clear failure of capitalism--misplaced incentives. BSC stockholders, watch out--your captain has sold out on you.
