I will be the first to admit that I wasn't the most excited when this newcomer beat Clinton in the primaries, but that doesn't mean I'd prefer McCain to him. Just an hour ago, I was reminded why that's the case.

Unlike McCain, [the Hoover of our age](node/389) whose belief is that the answer to our current economic woes is spending cuts, Obama [believes that](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aBcPiaRqqffg) this is the perfect time for "making public buildings more energy efficient, repairing schools and modernizing health care with electronic medical records," practically in-line with the infrastructure investments I exhorted. With short-run aggregate demand falling like a post-bubble stock on the NASDAQ, our primary concern should be redirecting our money where it should go: investment in the future.

Go Keynesian economics!
