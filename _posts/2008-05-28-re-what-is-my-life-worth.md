The supposed response to Jinghao's question below would probably be this:  More than yours.  Of course, such an offhand response is one that calls for disrespect, but I think in general, life is worth more than $50,000.  Simply, you cannot put a price tag on life.

In a world though where ideologies are dominated by self-interest, I think the worthiness of life is subjective, but judged by superlatives -- that is, I value person A more than person B because I have some affiliation with person A.  This is to say, I've met Jinghao, hung out with him and interacted with him, and I care about him.

Whereas, I have never met any of his EECS buddies.  In a sense, I really could care less about what happens to his EECS buddies because they have nothing in common with me.  Now if what happens to his EECS buddies affects Jinghao, I may care to a certain degree.  I suppose part of the argument has to do with degrees of separation as well:  The further I am away from you, the less I care what happens.  If a stranger gets hit by a car, I may pay attention to the news segment and walk away with the "that's too bad" mentality, but if that stranger's accident happens to hamper my afternoon commute, I might have the affinity to comment on why that stranger didn't bother to look both ways before he or she crossed.

I think this is how everything plays out in the simplest sense, neglecting the impacts of economics.  In another example, you can look to elephants, a species that exhibits very community-like traits.  If someone within the core group passes away, then the group mourns for that individual elephant.  However, if a stranger elephant dies nearby, they probably won't care.  This personality definitely applies in the human world.  I probably used too many examples, but you get the point.  In short, you can't measure life through money, but only through relative relationships.
