No. It ranked 43 of 63 on a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE4BA4MJ20081211">list of companies surveyed</a> for energy efficiency. IBM, Tesco PLC and Dell ranked first, second and third. "Organic" food isn't as good for the environment as you would think! (But in case you're wondering, Abercrombie & Fitch Co was last)
