Okay, as much as you'd like to insist, we are <i>NOT</i> Hindu. In fact, we're almost 180 Meridians away from the land where cows rule. Just take a look at any standard map--India's almost exactly half-way across the globe.

With that said, I will make clear that just because we aren't Hindus does not mean we cannot appreciate the beauty (right) of bovines. The clear difference is that while they do that in prayer, we do that at McDonald's.

Last thing on the agenda: I assure all readers that this website will not devote its resources and attention solely to cows and co. Don't fret.
