I guess it's customary to pick a fight with a significantly-larger neighbor and then ask for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7596862.stm">band-aids</a> (or money to pay for damaged war provisions). So explain to me why we are spending so much money to reward Georgia for its brazen provocations, further alienate a necessary world partner Russia, and put us further into debt, just as we forecast the world's largest public budget deficit. Huh?

(Just for reference, one billion dollars can feed 10 million children in Africa for a year)
