Israel wants [America to attack Iran](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/24/eveningnews/main4206201.shtml), potentially starting the third war since the start of this administration, none of which have completed yet. Although defense secretary Gates opposes a strike, Vice President Dick Cheney favors one. I don't think Bush will risk anything more, and I certainly hope he doesn't.

No more wars. Tell Israel to cool down or be attacked itself.
