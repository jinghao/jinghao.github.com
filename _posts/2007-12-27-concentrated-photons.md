A 15-year-old Las Vegas boy who "had just gotten his laser as a gift" was <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-laser28dec28,0,4745015.story?coll=la-home-center" rel="external">"arrested in Newport Beach on Christmas evening" for targeting the "pilots of a SkyWest Airlines plane"</a> and, later, the crew of an investigation police helicopter. Apparently "discharging laser[s] at aircraft[s]" is "a felony."

Crap, that foils my new-year's celebration plans. Does anyone have better ideas?
