Yet, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/12/AR2007091201515.html" target="_blank">life expectancy rates in the United States are at an all-time high</a>. At the rate American waistlines are expanding, I don't think this rise will continue much further.

What does that mean for us "of age" college folks? It means we better make our "contribution" to our beloved <s>empire</s>nation soon, before that rate begins to decline. Get to work, everyone!
