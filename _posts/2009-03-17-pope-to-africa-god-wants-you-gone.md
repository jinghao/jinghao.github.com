<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/homepageCrisis/idUSLH936617._CH_.2400">Pope Benedict</a> asserts that "the distribution of condoms ... increase the problem" of AIDS and hence reiterates "the Roman Catholic Church's opposition to the use of condoms in the fight against AIDS as he started a visit to Africa, where more than 25 million people have died from the disease in recent decades." The only reason he would tell such a blatant lie in the name of moral literacy is to encourage their creed to self-annihilate via the transmission of AIDS. So yes, people of Africa, listen to the minister of God and kill your kind.
