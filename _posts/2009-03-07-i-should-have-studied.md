...for one of my interviews yesterday by reviewing all the content covered by the XKCD comic, specifically the one about the Traveling Salesman Problem, for which I was only able to derive a brute-force algorithm in the short time I was given, but I knew there must've been a faster way.

But now I know that next time I have interviews I will spend my night studying my XKCD comics:
