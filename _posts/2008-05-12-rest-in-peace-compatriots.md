To the tens of thousands who have perished in the [7.8-Richter earthquake that struck Sichuan yesterday](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/frantic-search-for-thousands-trapped-by-chinese-quake-826992.html), rest in peace. China must not let this disaster go unnoticed; instead, China must let it be the drive for renewed discussions and action in earthquake-safety programs.

And to the political strategists in Taiwan who are [taking advantage of this devastation](http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1404960.php/Taiwan_search_rescue_team_ready_to_fly_to_quake-hit_Sichuan) to make a political statement: shame on you. Instead of offering assistance to the dislocated and disoriented, Taiwan's "<em>National</em>" Search and Rescue Team is taunting those victims with qualified offers of assistance: it "is awaiting a request from China for help" because "according to international conventions, <strong>foreign countries</strong> cannot dispatch search and rescue teams to a country unless that country requests help from the international community."

Why must you use this earthquake to force your motherland into a corner where it must either abandon its victims or its political standpoint? When you have the resources to help those <em>urgently</em> in need, why must you hold the dying and helpless for political ransom?

You are cruel. No good being would even consider blackmailing his family with <strong>real human lives</strong> into making an undesirable political statement. What happened to filial piety, Taiwan? Take this opportunity to demonstrate your camaraderie and help your cross-strait brothers in distress, please.
