The two main characters in a book I'm supposed to be reading for English (<em>American Psycho</em>) are named Patrick and Timothy. Coincidentally my two roommates share their names with those two obsessive-compulsive maniac-murderers. (Patrick also eats dead and rapes corpses) Should I be concerned?

If you've never heard of it, just know that it's a book full of weird characters with weirder fantasies:
<blockquote>While I stretch, the <em>Patty Winters Show</em> I watched this morning comes back to me. The topic was Big breasts and there was a woman on it who had a breast reduction since she thought her tits were too big--the dumb bitch. (P. 68)</blockquote>
<blockquote>I rerent <em>Body Double</em> because I want to watch it again tonight even though I know I won't have enough time to masturbate over the scene where the <em>woman is getting drilled to death by a power drill</em> (P. 69)</blockquote>
<blockquote>I come to the conclusion that <em>Patricia</em> is safe tonight, that I am not going to unexpectedly pull a knife out and use it on her just for the sake of doing so, that I am not going to get any pleasure watching her bleed from slits I've made by cutting her throat or slicing her neck open or gouging her eyes out. She's lucky, even though there's no real reasoning behind the luck. <em>It could be that she's safe because her wealth, her family's wealth, protects her</em> tonight, or it could be that it's simply my choice. ... Maybe it's simply that I don't want to ruin this particular Alexander Julian suit by having the bitch spray her blood all over it. (P. 77)</blockquote>
<blockquote>In my locker in the locker room at Xclusive lie three vaginas I recently sliced out of various women I've attacked in the past week. Two are washed off, one isn't. (P. 370)</blockquote>
