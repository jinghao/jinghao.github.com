What does it tell you when we care more about [people outside our country](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080608/ap_on_re_us/iraq_katrina) than in?  While crime rages in the inner cities, public education suffers, and the economy falters, we're giving money to those who aren't even citizens.  Kind of makes you wonder what it means to be American.
