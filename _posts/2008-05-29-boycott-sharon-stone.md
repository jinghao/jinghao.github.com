Sharon Stone, known for [baring it all](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103772/) in Basic Instinct (1992), came out yesterday, and made just about the stupidest comment of her life -- that the earthquake in China was caused none other than by [karma](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=7&entry_id=26847).  Really?  Natural disaster caused by a nation's response to chaos?  Now that's something new.

I'm not sure what is more disgusting, Stone's exhibition of sexual wanderlust on Michael Douglas' body in Basic Instinct, or her comment yesterday.  Both are equally sick, but the comment shows her absolute ignorance.  I'm not sure where she got her education, but as far as I am concerned, she's not all that smart.  The comment, I would argue, is quite in line with Muslim extremists saying that America deserved 9/11 and all the 3,000 individuals who died in that deserved to die.  So Sharon Stone a terrorist?  Yes.

Boycott Sharon Stone everyone.  Just as we saw with Abercrombie and Fitch and Rosie O'Donnell, both of whom showed little class, boycott her movies.  Don't support her.  And I suppose if she thinks that China deserved what it got, she ought to just take off all her Made-In-China clothing now, and go put on something made in Europe at the high cost.  She does after all, have the money.  Too bad we'd have to start at that ugly body of hers.  Ugh.
