I took the same <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm">Myer-Briggs personality test</a> as <a href="http://dailycow.org/node/74">I did two years ago</a>. Now I am ENTJ. The breakdown:
<ul>
<li>slightly expressed extrovert (-22% &rarr; <span style="color:red">11%</span>)</li>
<li>distinctively expressed intuitive personality (88% &rarr; 75%)</li>
<li>distinctively expressed thinking personality (69% &rarr; 75%)</li>
<li>very expressed judging personality (40% &rarr; 78%)</li>
</ul>
So now, instead of sharing a personality with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dwight Eisenhower, Colin Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Calvin Coolidge (Surprisingly, all relatively moderate Republicans), I now share a personality with Hillary Clinton, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Al Gore.

So apparently becoming extroverted makes me more of a Democrat?

EDIT: Apparently I also now share a personality with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Win?
