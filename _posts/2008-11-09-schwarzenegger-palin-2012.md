Only a couple years ago many of the Governator's closest political advisers were looking for ways for him to take advantage of his rising political prestige in traditionally-Democratic California to run for President, by constitutional amendment if necessary.

Well, that push has died down, but let's ponder the interesting possibilities should the amendment pass: Terminator/Miss Alaska on the Republican ticket, just to name one.

Let's get serious, though: Do you think that the constitutional provision that prohibits foreign-born American-citizens like Arnold from running for the top office is antiquated? Certainly in this country's infancy it provided good security against intentional state-sponsored and -organized sabotage of the US government, but is it still relevant now?

That is: Aren't our checks and balances enough to ensure that a democratically-elected president acts to promote the country's well-being, and to dispose of any president who breaches that contract?
