I took the same [Myer-Briggs personality test](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm) as [I did two years ago](http://dailycow.org/node/74). Now I am ENTJ. The breakdown:

* slightly expressed extrovert (-22% &rarr; <span style="color:red">11%</span>)
* distinctively expressed intuitive personality (88% &rarr; 75%)
* distinctively expressed thinking personality (69% &rarr; 75%)
* very expressed judging personality (40% &rarr; 78%)

So now, instead of sharing a personality with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dwight Eisenhower, Colin Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Calvin Coolidge (Surprisingly, all relatively moderate Republicans), I now share a personality with Hillary Clinton, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Al Gore.

So apparently becoming extroverted makes me more of a Democrat?

EDIT: Apparently I also now share a personality with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Win?
