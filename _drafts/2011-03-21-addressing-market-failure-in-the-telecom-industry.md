The American telecom industry is a shining example of a market failure: An industry with natural monopoly characteristics where existing regulation not only are unhelpful but contribute to the concentration of power. AT&T's recent attempt to acquire T-Mobile (America), whose obvious consequence is less competition for customers, serves to highlight that fact. Given the <a href="/node/1093">widespread (and unconcentrated) nature of the impact</a>, it is difficult for any individual or small groups of individuals to resolve the issue--competitors are not much better--so what can be done?

<h3>Monopolies Are Not Necessarily Bad</h3>

To tackle this problem, the first task is to dispel the ideology-bound myth that monopolies are always bad. Monopolies, with the right circumstances, are efficient (i.e. not evidence of market failure). It would be hugely wasteful if every city had multiple power companies, with each building its own lines and plants. As a result, regional monopolies are allowed (encouraged), but regulated to offer them competitive/market levels of return on equity. In this arrangement, each region is served by only one utility company, avoiding the redundant infrastructure that competition would bring.

Telecom is also an industry characterized by high fixed costs and tendency for natural monopolies.
