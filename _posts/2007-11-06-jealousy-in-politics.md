According to the [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/11/06/obama.colbert/index.html), "Obama supporters pressed officials to keep Colbert off ballot", although Obama's South Carolina communications director Kevin Griffis claimed that "ultimately it was South Carolina Democrats who made this decision." But "at least one member of the executive council" felt "pressured by former State Superintendent of Education Inez Tenenbaum to oppose placing Colbert on the ballot" because she (Tenenbaum) "thought it could have taken votes away from a lot of people." Clearly, there is a conflict of political interests here.

Scott Huffmon, a political scientist at Winthrop University, offers an explanation for this: "A lot of Obama's support is among younger, college-educated folks, and a lot of Colbert's watchers are younger, college-educated folks" and hence "Obama might potentially lose some voters." However, he also noted that "having Colbert on the ballot would likely bring in new primary voters rather than take them from other candidates," which is a "valid concern ... in a race where every vote counts."

Could it also be jealousy that drove Obama to drive Colbert off the ballot? Could it be the fact that Colbert found over a million supporters on Facebook alone within a week while Obama hasn't reached that level of prominence since he has declared his candidacy? Or is it just a political display of self-consciousness that highlights the volatility of the American political system?
