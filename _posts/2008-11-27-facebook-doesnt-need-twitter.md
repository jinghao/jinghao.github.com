Facebook and Twitter recently diverged on discussions about a potential "merger" (outright pre-IPO acquisition), mostly due to price, according to the [New York Times.](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/24/how-much-is-twitter-worth-to-facebook/) Twitter, which is currently cash-flow-negative and is expected to be for quite some time, is desperate for a cash infusion, but Facebook doesn't need it. Facebook has its own member base, status features, and business model. It doesn't need to deal with a money-losing business with no business model.
