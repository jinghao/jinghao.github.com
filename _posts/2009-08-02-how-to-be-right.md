At the same time that Alan Greenspan <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE5710W420090802">claimed</a> that "home prices had stabilized only temporarily--[we] <strong>could</strong> get a second wave down," he <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a2mJVPs5.HlQ">asserted</a> that "the most severe recession in at least five decades <strong>may</strong> be ending and growth <strong>may</strong> resume at a rate faster than <strong>most</strong> economists foresee." How useful are his "forecasts"?
