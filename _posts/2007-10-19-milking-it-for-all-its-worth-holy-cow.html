I figured since Nobel Laureates, while intelligent, have nothing to do with cows, I'd spread a little Friday cheer by posting some facts about... cows and what they eat (and give out), with facts taken from [here](http://www.geocities.com/cowseggs/cows.html).  Okay, so its a geocities site, but bear with me here...

<blockquote>

A 1,000 pound cow produces an average of 10 tons of manure a year. 

Per day, a cow spends 6 hours eating and 8 hours chewing cud. 

The average cow drinks about 30 gallons of water and eats about 95 pounds of feed per day. 

A cow stands up and lies down about 14 times a day. 

A cow's heart beats between 60 and 70 beats per minute. 

Cows can hear lower and higher frequencies better than humans. 
</blockquote>

I'm sure you can believe these facts, as they are probably pulled from other places.  But good lord -- 30 gallons of water a day, 6 hours of eating, 8 hours of chewing, 10 tons of manure/year.   If I even pulled that ratio-wise, from what cows eat and consume, I would be pretty fat.  But hey, I guess grass tastes good to them...
