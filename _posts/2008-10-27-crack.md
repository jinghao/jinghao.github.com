Here's one thing that really bothers me: girls with half their butt crack exposed. Is that supposed to be fashionable? I certainly don't think it is (or should be). However, it is <i>very</i> disturbing. Here I am, trying to concentrate on schoolwork in the library, and a girl pulls up next to me featuring the symptom described in this blog post. How inconsiderate could a person be? What I don't understand is how can a girl stand exposing her sensitive arse to a cool breeze without immediately pulling her pants up, as a natural reflex? What's become of our society? Is butt crack the new cleavage?
