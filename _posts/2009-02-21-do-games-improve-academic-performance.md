In response to the [Microsoft initiative to explore the educational link to video games](http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_11748201) (basically justifying addiction to World of Warcraft because it "can encourage scientific thinking"), a junior at Fargo South High School claimed that "I've played a lot of puzzle-solving games and they actually help sharpen my brain," which by itself could be a respectable claim.

Then he continued: "My <strong>reaction time</strong> has actually gone <strong>up</strong>, thanks to playing video games." Somehow I doubt that those games sharpened her brain. I laughed when I picked up the irony of the statement.

If the Mercury News replaces the article, check [this](/system/files/article.pdf). If you laughed, please [Digg this page](http://digg.com/comedy/Do_Games_Improve_Academic_Performance).
