In 1992, the University of Chicago reported that on average, men have 74% more opposite-gender sex partners than women.

Wait, what?

Oh yeah, we're supposed to prove that's not possible. But seriously, how could the University of Chicago have missed that?

The university made the wrong conclusion from their "research." Instead of concluding that men have more sexual partners than women, they should have concluded that men are more open about their lays. Well, some are. But that's why we're dealing with averages.
