In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/13/opinion/13tues1.html" rel="external">New York Times editorial</a>, the author argues that "the recent crash of an Air Force F-15 fighter jet ... is the latest reminder of the tough military budget choices this country will face for the foreseeable future--even if American troops were withdrawn from Iraq tomorrow, billions of dollars would still be needed to replenish military equipment, swap aging weapons systems for new ones and rebuild and expand ground forces strained to the breaking point by this misguided war."

Is this about the same military that gets almost a trillion dollars each year--more than the military budget of all other industrialized nations <strong>combined</strong>? The same military that purports to bring "Freedom" and "Democracy" to countries like Iraq? The same one that does not need <em>any</em> high-tech weaponry in its fight against guerrilla fighters and insurgents?

Explain to me why we need F-22As to fight suicide bombers in Iraq, please. I must be retarded for not understanding the "logic" in that.
