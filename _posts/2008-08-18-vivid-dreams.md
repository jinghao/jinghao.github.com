Last night, I had a vivid dream. That's not new, because I have vivid dreams every night, and they're very <i>very</i> weird. Like, last night, I remember dreaming that I was in a school. And a teacher had gone crazy and was starting a massacre, killing everyone in school with a machine gun, and I remember hiding behind a desk. And one schoolmate -- I don't know who -- rose up from behind another desk with his own gun to defend the school, but was shot down brutally. And then I remember standing, but I moved 'out' -- I floated away. And it turns out that I was watching myself on TV, watching the final episode of a TV show about a school. Wow, that was a weird way to end a TV show. Then I woke up. I had been dreaming. I told my brother about the dream... and then I woke up again. And told my brother. I had been in a TV show within a dream within a dream. Four levels of reality deep. That was really creepy. And the creepiest bit is... I could still be dreaming right now.
