Now contraceptives are [between 85 to 90% cheaper](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/opinion/14sat4.html) than before for college students. We just need to extend that to the whole population and the entire world can avoid the fate that Sir Thomas Malthus predicted two centuries ago. Nigeria, for instance, is producing so many kids that it will swell to over 300 million in a couple decades if the rates are not adversely affected by disease and food shortages.

Perhaps people there should have fewer kids. Free (or extremely affordable) contraceptives will be the first step to achieving that.
