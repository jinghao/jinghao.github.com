Businessman Tomas Delgado, a Spanish driver who "had been driving at excessive speed" when he "collided with a cyclist" but "has faced no criminal charges for the incident," is "<a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=oddlyEnoughNews&storyid=2008-01-25T153716Z_01_EIC556225_RTRUKOC_0_US-SPAIN-DRIVER1.xml" rel="external">suing the dead youth's family $29,300</a> for the damage the impact of his body did to his ... Audi A8 in the fatal 2004 crash in La Rioja region" because he believes that he is "also a victim in all of this" and that although "you can't fix the lad's problems" since he has already passed away, "you can fix [Delgado's]." The victim's family who had "previously pitied Delgado for the guilt he must feel at killing their son" were now "disgusted that his greatest concern appeared to be money."

They <strong>should</strong> be very disgusted. We should likewise be very disgusted, but not surprised: The world is full of ironies; this is just one of them.
