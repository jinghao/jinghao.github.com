Just pick a rich corporation that isn't based in your region and make up some lame excuses to fine it over <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/011709-europe-charges-microsoft-with-abuse.html">2 billion dollars</a> (1.6 billion Euros). I mean, so what if Microsoft "bundles" Windows Photo Gallery, Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer? They're trying to sell a ready-to-go operating system for the average consumer. If you didn't have SOME browser to start off with, you wouldn't be able to get the alternatives you want!

I don't see Europe acting so nationalistically in regards to its own software companies. Oh wait, it has none!

IE and WMP may suck, but they are better than nothing, and are pretty decent starting points for most people. Europe is just trying to cover its budgetary ass by improperly fining companies that already pay ample amounts of cash in taxes.
