It would be:
<ol>
<li>300 billion dollars to states, $1000 for each resident, with up to that much more at the Treasury rate, and insure state debt for 10 years. Let the states pay for education with this money</li>
<li>200 billion dollars for infrastructure development: High speed rail, subway systems, upgrading/fixing bridges, modernized bus systems</li>
<li>50 billion dollars for health: Modernization of infrastructure and preventive care (immunizations, etc)</li>
<li>50 billion dollars for alternative energy research/production subsidies</li>
<li>50 billion dollars for miscellaneous projects (WiMax for rural areas, for example) that promote equity and efficiency, not pet projects that benefit only very specific people (No pork)</li>
</ol>
As you notice, that's somewhat less than the stimulus we have in place today and contains no tax cuts.
