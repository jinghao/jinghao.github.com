Why do regions that pretend to be "fiscally conservative" (Say, states like Louisiana, Georgia and Mississippi) send in so much less to Washington than more liberal regions like New York City and San Francisco? Maybe some states are fiscally conservative by necessity--I mean, if your population is a bunch of poor bums it's pretty difficult to raise taxes on them. But they should avoid complaining about the amount of spending that's planned. After all, although poor regions send in the least tax (Think of Mississippi), they're getting the most out of the stimulus.

Stop complaining, hypocrites. Otherwise we'll go by a state-by-state basis.
