Instead of reinvesting its enormous profits by developing and upgrading its infrastructure, Comcast, which just "reported a 54 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit and an increase in digital video, broadband Internet and phone subscribers," declared that it would ["complete its 7 billion dollar stock buyback program"](http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSWNAS098720080214) by 2009 and offer quarterly dividends totaling 750 million dollars a year. What good does it do for Comcast and its subscribers for it to boost its share price by sacrificing future growth?

Corporate dividends and share buyback programs never made sense to me; it just sounds so much like irresponsible and confused spending. This is why America can't have nice things (in this case, fast Internet access). (It's pretty pathetic how many countries in the world has cheaper and faster Internet access than we do; now we know why)
