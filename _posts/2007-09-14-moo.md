Well hello, I'm Joey, the official cow of...the Daily Cow. See that cow up there on the top left? That's me. 

Just kidding. But I have to warn you, cows are quite contagious. No, not in terms of disease, because the FDA will assure you that cows, especially our cows, are very clean animals. And we totally trust the FDA, right? (mmm spinach). But no, I mean contagious in its very essence and ideology. The ideology of cows...doesn't that sound like a whole lot of BS? Maybe it is, but what better place to put it than here? Jinghao made that cow icon for me several years back when I had an...affinity for cows. It's quite a work of art isn't it? Can't you just imagine a bovine breaking out into that mischievous smile? I thought I'd never see it again, but here it is now...on the daily cow. Looks like Jinghao caught cow fever.
