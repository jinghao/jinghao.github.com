...doesn't mean you should mold your life around it. In a clear repudiation of the study that concluded that "[women ... prefer to have a male partner who physically resembles him](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/features/daily-features/article2652903.ece)", Jenny and John Deaves, who have one living daughter between them, "have been banned from having sex after a court convicted the pair on two counts of incest ... as it emerged that a [previous child of the daughter-father couple died a few days after birth](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article3697361.ece)."

That's unfortunate. Incest is gross. They should be sent to jail (separate compartments ideally) for sending innocent children into the world to die at birth.
