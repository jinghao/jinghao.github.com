Because I read at a first grader's level of comprehension now (I could read more when I was three!). But how am I going to find the time to learn it while simultaneously trying to earn three degrees in four years? Or if I include the 5-year MS, EECS program, four degrees in five years? I don't want to quit the Haas job either (it's kind of cool to have such control over all of the Haas servers)--and "...to learn Chinese" is just such a pathetic reason for quitting.

What about those tapes that stuff words into you while you're sleeping? Well, I can't learn to read by listening... Bummer. Yeah, I want to go to Singapore at the end of my sophomore or junior year (for the summer) and I don't want to look clueless (even if I am).
