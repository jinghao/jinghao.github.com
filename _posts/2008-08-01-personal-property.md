US federal agents are given the power to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSN0126069520080801" rel="external">seize</a> "travelers' laptops and other electronic devices at the border and hold them for unspecified periods ... without suspicion of wrongdoing." They are also "empowered to share the contents of seized computers with other agencies and private entities." According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the policies apply to "anyone entering the country, including U.S. citizens" and are "needed to prevent terrorism."

Does our government have the right to look at private data without suspicion of wrongdoing? What if they were searching for data involving nuclear technology and find on the laptop pictures of the "suspect"'s 5-month-old son in a bath tub? (Is that child pornography?)
