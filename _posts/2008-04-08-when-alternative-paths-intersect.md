Many of us claim to be environmentalist, but how many of us actually act on that claim? Ironically, the interests of those whose actions are most aligned with this environmentalist ideology clashed in a legal dispute over how tall your neighbor's trees can be: Mr. Vargas wins a legal case against his green, Prius-driving neighbor for maintaining trees that cover more than 10% of his newly-installed photovoltaic power system (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/07/science/earth/07redwood.html" rel="external">link</a>). Should laws--which ostensibly were intended to encourage investment in solar power--be abused in this way? What is the effectiveness of removing redwood trees to satisfy synthetic solar cells, which are inherently much less efficient than nature?

Does this make any sense?
