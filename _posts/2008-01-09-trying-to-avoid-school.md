Diego Palacios, a 10-year-old Mexican boy who "didn't want to go to school because vacation was so much fun", "sneaked into the kitchen in the early hours and then covered his hand with [industrial-strength adhesive](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,320957,00.html)." After attempting unsuccessfully for two hours to detach Diego's hands from his bed, his mother, who believes that Diego "<i>is a good boy but mischievous</i>", invited the paramedics, who freed his hand "just in time for school." Aren't some people just desperate? He's probably one of those disruptive people in class anyway, so it might have been better for his classmates for him not to attend.
