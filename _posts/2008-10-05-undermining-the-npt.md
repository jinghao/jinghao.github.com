The US and India worked hard to secure an illegal deal to undermine the legitimacy of the (Nuclear) Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), now permitting the transfer of nuclear technology and materials to India, which is not a signatory of the NPT.

In doing so, the US lost all international leverage by legitimate means over Iran and its enrichment program and North Korea's nuclear arms program. By forgiving India's defiance of the NPT (by testing a nuclear weapon in spite of international opposition), the US ceded similar rights to independent states Iran and North Korea. Iran has every right to be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE4941KO20081005">incensed</a> about the US's clear favoritism.

How could the US claim that Iran and NK not have the right to possess nuclear technology but encourage India's active defiance of international order?
