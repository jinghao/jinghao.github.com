The US Federal Government made a commendable step toward full accountability for its whole stimulus package with the new website (http://www.recovery.gov) which details where each dollar is spent and the estimated effects of each dollar, such as in terms of job creation.

How many people noticed that the website uses the same back-end CMS as the Daily Cow? (We use [Drupal](http://drupal.org)) I hope Drupal doesn't encounter any more security issues.
