Okay, so the Black-Eyed Peas aren't exactly the quintessential message-senders of contemporary society, but they are reknowned enough to the point where what they say will be acknowledged.  Much like what Paris Hilton does and what Britney Spears wears, that's what American pop culture is good for -- yes we will still oogle at the breasts of Jessica Alba, never stop staring at the curvy figure of Jennifer Lopez or stop staring at Leonardo DiCaprio, but if they say anything, we listen.  If a scientist can't convey a message of global warming, or that something in the world needs changing, the least we could do is well... depend on a star.  Yes, the message will be diluted with massive amounts of detailed errors, but the general message will be heeded.  And in a society where we want things fast and on the go, getting the message out is the least anyone can do.
