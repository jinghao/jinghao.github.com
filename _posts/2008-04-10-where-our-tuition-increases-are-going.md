The <a href="http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_8821969" rel="external">tree-sitters</a> in and around U.C. Berkeley's campus have cost the police department over 300,000 dollars, wasted manpower and quite some bit of distractions. At the same time, the state is cutting the budget for its prestigious university system and we are feeling the pain through additional service cuts and fee increases.

If those tree-sitters weren't so bullheaded, I would have admitted that I admired their perseverance and determination, but they are just plain ignorant and selfish. The police department should give them an ultimatum: "Come down from the trees or you're going with the trees. Oh, by the way, you're paying for the students' security fees."

Money squandered is opportunity lost.
