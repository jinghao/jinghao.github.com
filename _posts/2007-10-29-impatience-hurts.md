In an interview during the show "60 Minutes", [French President Nicolas Sarkozy "snorted" "No, no. This is stupid" and called his press secretary an "imbecile".](http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/29/europe/sarkozy.php) He added through a translator that, [in contrast to the American "President"], he doesn't "have the time" for the interview because he has "a big job to do...a schedule". I wonder if the French voted for impatience when they selected the conservative over the socialist.
