I ordered THREE [miniature train sets](http://www.woot.com/Blog/BlogEntry.aspx?BlogEntryId=3404) midnight. I hope they aren't covered with lead paint.

EDIT: Oh goody. Looks like they're not on the [list of toy hazard recalls compiled by the consumer product safety commission.](http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/category/toy.html)
