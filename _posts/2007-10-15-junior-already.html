Bearfacts thinks I'm already a Junior. From the profile page:
<blockquote><u>General Status</u>
Education Level: JUNIOR
Non-AP Level: FRESHMAN
Future (Telebears) Level: SENIOR</blockquote>
And from "All Grades" under "Academic Record":
<blockquote>SEMESTER CREDITS COMPLETED: 78.2</blockquote>
Go AP & college courses!
