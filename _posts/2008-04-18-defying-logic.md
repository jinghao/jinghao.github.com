<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/18/BAE71080SS.DTL" rel="external">A Berkeley man</a> "drove his car at speeds topping 80 mph into several parked vehicles in North Berkeley," causing his Subaru to become "airborne for a short time before landing on its roof on top of the pickup truck," yet "no one else was injured." For some reason, I don't think that's possible. Perhaps the San Francisco Chronicle editors should be more vigilant in detecting obvious mistakes.
