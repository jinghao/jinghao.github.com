"[South Korea launched a special investigation into Samsung Group (SAGR.UL)](http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSSEO26105420080110)", the South Korean conglomerate that accounts for a sixth of Korea's GDP and a fifth of its stock market, on suspicions that it created a 200 billion won slush fund to "bribe public officials to squash investigations into its management practices." A company with such political and economic influence would never be allowed to form in the United States or Europe. It is certainly dangerous for one group, whose clandestine operations are clearly worth investigating, to have more power than does the central government.
