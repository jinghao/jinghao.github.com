[P. Selvakumar, a man in southern India, wed Selvi, a female stray dog](http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22756699-5002700,00.html), "in a traditional Hindu ceremony as atonement for stoning two other dogs to death" because "an astrologer reportedly told P. Selvakumar that the wedding was the only way to lift the curse."

I wonder if the marriage was consummated. Well, the same source ambiguously declared that, as a result of the marriage, "dog got a bun." I wonder what that could mean.
