Remember when you watched cookie monster?  Big Bird?  Or how ridiculously amused you were with Elmo?  According to Virginia Heffermen of the New York Times, the newly released first few seasons of Sesame Street on DVD do not cater to the younger generation of today because ["Anyone who considers bull markets normal, extracurricular activities sacrosanct and New York a tidy, governable place — well, the original “Sesame Street” might hurt your feelings."](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/magazine/18wwln-medium-t.html)  For a show that was regarded in the '90s as a staple of children's television, the '70s version is much more straightforward and to the point:  Mentions of stagflation, a worsening economic climate and <i>live action cows</i> don't really relate to the sheltered, put-away child of today.  Not to mention, the '70s version, viewed at a much higher rate by those within inner cities and higher-crime areas.

Not so Barney, if you ask me about it.
