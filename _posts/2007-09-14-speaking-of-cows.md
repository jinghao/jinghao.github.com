Why is Berkeley Farms located in Hayward? (Don't answer) Since attending elementary school in California (since fourth grade), I've always wanted to go to Berkeley--why?--to see the cows so profusely advertised on the sides of the school-sized "Berkeley Farms" milk cartons. I feel so deceived. 

P.S. This has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the previous entry, except for the fact that they both deal with cows.
