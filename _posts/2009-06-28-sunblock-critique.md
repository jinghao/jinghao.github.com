Summer has arrived! We "cows" spend lots of time in the sun, so here is a review of the sunblock tested by your very own sunblock critic, me. 

<b>Coppertone Sport Sunblock Lotion, Ultra Sweatproof, SPF 30</b>

This sunscreen is fairly cheap and easy to use. No fancy smells or perfume. It's quite runny despite the "ultra dry formula" label, which actually makes it easy to spread. However, be careful not to let it drip on the carpet or your clothes. 

<b>Target Sport Sunscreen - Continuous Spray, SPF 30</b>

A no-rub sunscreen? It seemed like a good idea. However, breathing in the fumes was not fun. Also, the spray stinked up my room and carpet for hours. Be careful when spraying - a thin film did not seem to block as much UV. If you don't mind coughing on the fumes, this sunscreen is fast and convenient. Plus, it's transparent so you don't have to worry about walking around with a white blob on your nose. 

<b>Lancome UV Expert 20 Sunscreen, SPF 20</b>

It's expensive ($35 for 3.4 oz. at Macy's), but it works very well and doesn't feel oily. Although the SPF is lower than the Target Sport Sunscreen above, it's better at blocking UV rays. It's white and has a thick consistency, so be wary of white patches after applying. 

<b>Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock, SPF 70</b>

This sunblock works very well. It does smell a bit funny, but the smell is well worth the SPF 70 protection. Despite the high SPF, it feels "lighter" (less thick) than the Lancome sunblock. It's quite inexpensive - around $10 for a 3 oz. tube. 

<b>Alba Hawaiian Green Tea Suncreen, SPF 30</b>

This smells good! It's probably the best smelling sunblock I've tried. Buy it for the smell! It's almost as runny as the Coppertone SPORT sunblock, so beware the drip. 

<b>Hawaiian Tropic 45plus Sunblock, SPF 45</b>

One of my favorites. It smells good (like coconut) and works fine. However, it leaves my skin feeling oily, so I wouldn't use it on my face. Also, I'm a bit skeptical of the "all day waterproof." 

That's all of the ones that I can remember! Feel free to post your own recommendations.
