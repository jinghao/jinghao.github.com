A Republican from Louisiana suggested that <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/economic-eugenics/" rel="external">poor women should be given economic incentives</a> to have their Fallopian tubes tied up, with the hope that ultimately more affluent people will have more kids, and the general populace will be less dependent on government aid. And plus, poor people won't have to have so many kids, and they will have this money to spend on fewer kids--hence improved welfare.

If it weren't for the racial links to economic status (blacks are generally more economically disadvantaged, especially in the south, than whites, for example), I wouldn't consider this a controversial proposition. In fact, it makes perfect sense from a pragmatic point of view: Better welfare for everyone, and a more progressive and vibrant economy.

What do you guys think? Is it worth the controversies that arise?
