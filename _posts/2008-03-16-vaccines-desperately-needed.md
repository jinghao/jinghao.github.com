Considering that at least <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/11/AR2008031101342.html" rel="external">26% of America's girls aged 14-19 (and that includes the non-active ones) have "experienced at least one sexually transmitted infection"</a> (those infections do NOT include pregnancy--sorry, ladies!) and that many of these infections are easily preventable with vaccines, being vaccinated against common infections (such as HPV) should be absolutely mandatory. HPV accounts for 70% of all infections and eliminating that would reduce infection rates significantly. I am not arguing for substitutes for safe practices--I am arguing that additional measures can be taken to ensure everyone's health and safety.

Why do I care? Because America spends too much on health-related issues for things that are easily treatable. Prevention helps everybody, including unrelated bystanders (Economists, recall the social marginal benefit of ensuring the health of others). Hence, all proven (and reasonably affordable) vaccines for common ailments should be made mandatory (but that's a topic for discussion on another day).

One last thing, why aren't Asians even mentioned? We know that half of all African-American girls have some STD infection and that a fifth of white girls have that--but that's an incomplete picture. (Hey, maybe some people actually know what temperance means)
