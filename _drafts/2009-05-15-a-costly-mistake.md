The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124240088772024143.html">House plans to</a> <em>give away 85%</em> of the carbon emission credits to the industries that already pollute the most. Yes, they plan to <em>give away</em> pollution rights to the very industries that have been polluting our planet for the past few centuries. These rights are exchangeable and have value for the same reason that your greenback has value.

It's a mistake to subsidize their polluting. The possibility of free exchange does not guarantee efficient allocation, so the initial allocation mechanism is still important. Even a simple auction will be more efficient
