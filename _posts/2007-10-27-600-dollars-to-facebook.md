Less than a week ago, <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/071024/facebook_microsoft.html" target="_blank">Microsoft bought 1.6% of Facebook for 240 million dollars</a>, which, although it is only spare change for Microsoft, values the startup at 15 billion dollars. Facebook has 50 million members, at least half of whom are active daily on average. That values each of us daily Facebook users (on average) at 600 dollars.

Is that too much? I think so. In its entire lifetime, Facebook can't expect to wring 600 bucks from me no matter how many advertisements I see. Honestly, I haven't clicked on a single one yet, although I'm sure I've used more than a dollar's worth of server resources (after all, Facebook even hosts Opera downloads for free).

What do you think? Did Microsoft make a fatal mistake? Was it duped by Google into overpaying for something that is not worth half as much? It probably was; after all, Google is run by a triumvirate of brilliant strategists.
