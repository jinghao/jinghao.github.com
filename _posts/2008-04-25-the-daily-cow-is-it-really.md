As all <em>the Daily Cow</em> readers know, we are not endorsing and do not endorse cows--so to question the validity of our name is to question the validity of the "Daily." Therefore we must ask: Are we really daily?
<!--break-->
When we began, <em>the Daily Cow</em> was more than daily; we wrote articles more than once a day on average in order to entertain our nascent readers. But those articles were frivolous quarter-page posts about insignificant topics (<a href="node/14">Why Berkeley Farms is in Hayward</a>, <a href="node/13">how to kill a baby cow</a>, and <a href="node/23">what do cows drink?</a>--okay, so I admit that we do talk about cows, but that's not our primary interest!).

Then we became more disruptive (<a href="node/165">The original FreeRice Autoclicker</a>, <a href="node/200">one written in Java</a>, <a href="node/207">the campaign and proof that FreeRice is a scam</a>, and finally <a href="node/214">an angry comment from the World Food Program manager and my subsequent reply</a>) and activist (<a href="node/235">Insider trading of Bear Stearns</a>, <a href="node/211">the anachronism called dividends</a> and <a href="node/216">opacity in defense initiatives</a>).

But recently, we have migrated into the realm of the more-thoughtful and philosophical (<a href="node/266">The role of living wages</a>, <a href="node/263">trust in partnership</a>, and <a href="node/260">the antagonism over the Beijing Olympics</a>). Understandably, these articles require more thought to produce--otherwise, it would do you readers no good to read a jumbled mess of unorganized thoughts.

It used to be that I could just sit down and produce an article in five short minutes. For better or for worse, that cannot happen anymore unless we regress to the days during which we were in our infancy. So dear readers, please excuse our irregular posts. They are necessary to ensure that we produce thoughtful posts.

Although the last few posts are not exemplary of thoughtfulness, hopefully the next few will be. Please bear with us as we adjust to the transformation.
