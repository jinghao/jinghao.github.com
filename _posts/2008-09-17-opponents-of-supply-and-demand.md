The daily riders of BART are complaining that the transit administration has finally realized how to stop losing immense amounts of money: to use supply and demand to its advantage. BART wants to <a href="http://www.contracostatimes.com/localnews/ci_10491156" rel="external">adjust rates</a> based on ridership/demand so that the nearly-constant supply is balanced out with the demand. (In other words, so the BART trains aren't excessively full, overloaded, and hence delayed)

Of course the best idea is to simply stop idling the trains during peak times and to decrease the delay between each train. 15 minutes is excessive. It doesn't take 15 minutes to stop after finding out that the train in front of you stopped. Five is the absolute maximum we need.

But if that's not what BART administration wants to do, adjusting rates to ensure that the demand does not exceed supply is a smart move.

People, stop complaining about this. If fares are cheap, they complain that they have nowhere to sit and are crowded into the most unwanted regions of the train. If fares are less cheap, well, what they complain about is obvious.
