New York Times columnist John R. Quain <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/automobiles/11WEB.html" rel="external">claims</a> that "faster wireless access is expected next year when Sprint and its partner Clearwire begin to sell a mobile WiMax service called Xohm," which "promises to make video calls from the car a snap, as well as eliminating hiccups when watching streaming video from sites like YouTube or listening to streaming music from services like Rhapsody." He envisions "WiMax navigation devices [that] could not only get traffic information more quickly for improved accuracy, but also let drivers tap into live traffic Webcams to see what backups really look like."

It's nice that Mr. Quain is thinking ahead into the future when we will all have wireless internet access, but it might be helpful to consider the present, too. After all, Sprint <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=marketsNews&storyID=2007-11-09T171147Z_01_N09315987_RTRIDST_0_SPRINT-CLEARWIRE-UPDATE-4.XML" rel="external">postponed (perhaps indefinitely) its WiMax plans and thus its partnership with Clearwire</a>, sending <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=clwr" rel="external">Clearwire stocks down over 36% from an intra-week high.</a> WiMax sounds nice, but if the companies deploying it nationwide cannot make it affordable for the average consumer, it won't gain much traction. Good luck, Clearwire. And Mr. Quain, check your "facts" before reporting about them.
