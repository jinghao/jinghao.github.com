In response to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/world/asia/24evaders.html" rel="external">Beijing's "ambitious nationwide campaign to reduce energy consumption two years ago"</a> that stipulated in part that the ridiculously-low electricity prices must be raised to stem the growth in heavy (and inefficient) industry, "local officials arranged for [Qingtongxia Aluminum Group] (which accounts for 20 percent of the region’s industrial consumption and roughly 10 percent of its gross domestic product) to be removed from the national electrical grid and supplied directly by the local company, exempting it from expensive fees." In effect, "Qingtongxia continued to get its power at the lowest price available," rendering the central policy irrelevant.

The central government constantly makes its impatience with unruly local officials obvious. In May, China’s premier, Wen Jiabao, "complained bitterly that understanding [the efforts to cut energy consumption] is not adequate, responsibilities are unclear, measures are not complementary, policies are incomplete, investment doesn’t arrive, and coordination is ineffective; if these problems are not turned around, it will be difficult to achieve any obvious progress."

In a world covered by a single, continuous atmosphere, Sulfur-Dioxide emitted by an aluminum ore company in an obscure and underdeveloped region of China causes the smog and acid rain in Los Angeles, and the Carbon Dioxide emitted by refineries in Texas causes "permafrost" in Siberia to melt. Hence, it is everyone's duty to ensure that every inhabitant of this shared planet fulfills his responsibility to preserve the environment. China and the world cannot afford to let disobedient local officials set the policies that ruin the environment for everyone else, yet the same officials are only heeding to local ambitions for economic growth.

The answer is that growth can be found in non-dirty industry too. Beijing needs to provide tax incentives for a strong clean, high-margin technology industry to provide the job and productivity growth that will balance the decline of dirty industry. In order for technology and innovation to look more attractive, Beijing must protect and respect intellectual-property rights. The day China moves completely away from being Walmart's factory to becoming the home of the globally-reputed companies such as Google, Microsoft, Intel, Sony, and IBM is also the day the world will begin to see more sunlight.

Additionally, China needs its own nuclear-power and clean-coal industry to help replace the country's dirty-coal plants.
