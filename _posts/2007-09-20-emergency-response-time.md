The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7004059.stm" target="_blank">"super-typhoon" Wipha</a>, "which was predicted to be the worst in a decade", hit "China's densely-populated eastern coast" Yesterday and left five dead from storm-induced landslides. And, despite the storm's immensity, "Shanghai, a city of 17 million people, escaped with little damage and was reported to be returning to normal on Thursday."

Compare that to Katrina--thousands of people died; hundreds of billions of dollars in economic capacity disappeared; hundreds of thousands of homes were wrecked; and crude prices were permanently pushed to record prices.

So why did this happen to the United States of America, a much more affluent country, but not to China, a much more densely-populated country? Because there was much less bureaucracy to navigate through in the authoritarian government, and thus China could have better emergency-preparation plans: "a total of 2.7 million people were moved from their homes to temporary shelters, flights grounded and schools and public buildings closed as the typhoon approached."

If America had done this instead of bicker about what to do, I believe thousands of lives could've been saved, and hundreds of billions of dollars in economic devastation could have been avoided. So where, again, do our tax dollars go? Oh right: Iraq.
