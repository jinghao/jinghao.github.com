I get asked about programming mishaps--bugs I've encountered, obstacles I had to cross, etc--in my interviews, and I can never come up with anything, leading them to think of me as a snotty little kid who thinks he's too good to make mistakes. Well, I just don't remember them specifically, so I thought it might be helpful if I kept a repository of programming mishaps I encounter on the Daily Cow. Writing will make me remember them, right?

I have one right now, which I'll write up soon. For an example of what I mean, check out my <a href="http://dailycow.org/node/485">previous post about a CS project</a> in which not realizing that I needed a terminating newline led my program to produce inscrutable errors.
