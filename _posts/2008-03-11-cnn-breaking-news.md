At 5:02 PM today, I get this:
<blockquote>Barack Obama wins the Mississippi Democratic primary, <strong>CNN projects.</strong></blockquote>
Then 11 minutes later, at 5:13 PM, I get this:
<blockquote>Exit polls show Obama leading Clinton in Mississippi. <strong>CNN has not projected this race.</strong></blockquote>
Just a few minutes ago, at 5:38PM, I get this:
<blockquote><strong>CNN projects</strong> that Sen. Barack Obama will win the Mississippi Democratic primary.</blockquote>
Maybe I should stop subscribing to these "Breaking News" emails.
