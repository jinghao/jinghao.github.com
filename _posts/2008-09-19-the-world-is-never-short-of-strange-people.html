From Saturday's [Dear Abby](http://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/) column:
<blockquote>DEAR ABBY: I'm 39 and a college graduate with plenty of common sense. I'm not stupid, yet throughout my life I have had trouble differentiating between left and right, east and west. Any explanation? -- LOST IN PENNSYLVANIA</blockquote>
Abby kindly responds:
<blockquote>Fortunately for you, cell phones can be outfitted with GPS devices to help you find your way. And as to your difficulty differentiating between left and right, hold both hands in front of you with palms out and thumbs touching. Notice how the angle of your left hand forms an "L"? I hope this solves your problem.</blockquote>
So Joey wonders, "why is that even printed," a question he immediately answers: the world "must be running out of messed up people."

Not quite, I said. Let's take a look at the next one:
<blockquote>DEAR ABBY: Please help me. Several years ago, my granddaughter -- age 17 -- beat me up. It was awful. She beat me all over and broke my knee. I have forgiven her, but somehow it eats at me. What should I do? I will never forget that beating, which happened because I wouldn't let her drive my car. -- GEORGIA GRANDMOTHER</blockquote>
