When Senator George Mitchell handed down his <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=AmP9NQTT2SP8BLoDBBERuiERvLYF/SIG=124ukajq3/**http%3A//us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/sp/mlb/pdf/mitchrpt1.pdf">report</a> detailing performance enhanced drug use on Thursday, he dealt a significant blow to what many Americans consider their heroes -- sports stars.  Individuals such as Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds, Miguel Tejada and countless others were named in a report that accused them of purchasing performance enhancing drugs to boost their personal statistics.  This report was mostly a witch hunt, but when you think about it, what gives?

In the realm of athletics, especially of the professional kind, you really have to question the player's <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news;_ylt=Ak2SAywoiD.y9CzedViTu.0RvLYF?slug=ap-yankees-rodriguez&prov=ap&type=lgns">love of the game</a>.  More so, you even have to wonder whether it is a game anymore.  When you have individuals making $275 million over 10 years, like Mr Alex Rodriguez, a salary that is comparable to many of the movie stars that reside in Hollywood, you have to wonder whether baseball, or any other sport, is really played for the love of the game, or for the paycheck.  After all, if people were really playing baseball for the love of the game, would they really ask for that much?  So really, when you look at the result of it all, why not let athletes take steroids?  When we the fans are the end user, how many of us care whether someone used performance enhancing drugs? It only makes our hard earned money look more worthy.

Thoughts?
