Hey, at least in <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/beijing/basketball/news;_ylt=AoRqJTHw6ez3ytHIyUNU6KyVTZd4?slug=ap-bko-us-china&prov=ap&type=lgns_lie/post/BDL-Live-Blog-USA-vs-China?urn=nba,99693">something</a>, the US can still win.  But then again, basketball does not equate to economic or global dominance.
