With the massive 32% tuition hike on top of endless years of double-digit increases, the University of California is not far from achieving full privatization. The days of world class education for the public are quickly coming to an end due to incompetence higher up. The potential of California's future is being gradually sacrificed to feed the hunger of the past.

We are entering an unmitigated cycle of doom and bust. The treasure that has attracted the world's brightest will soon be nothing but the smoke from a smothered candle.
