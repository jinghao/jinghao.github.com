American Airlines allowed a 30-year-old woman who had an acute and difficult-to-treat form of tuberculosis and "<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN04326416" rel="external">sought hospital treatment for coughing up blood, fever and for chest pain</a>" onto a 23-hour flight (calculated from the arithmetic average of <a href="http://www.flightstochicagous.com/flights-chicago/cheap-flights/delhi/" rel="external">all flights</a>) from New Delhi to Chicago, endangering the health (and lives) of the "44 people" who "sat within two rows of the woman or were crew members working in the same cabin" and are being tracked down "to determine whether they have been infected." So, how many times has the United States let in acutely-infected passengers via air, endangering the health of everyone they enter into contact with?
