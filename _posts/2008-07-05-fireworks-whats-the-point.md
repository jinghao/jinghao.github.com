Independence day calls for a mega-celebration with tons of fireworks (literally). But after seeing the exorbitant display of chemical brilliance, I'm forced to wonder: what's the point?

At a time when the whole world is under increasing pressure to cut emissions and when the heat waves are making forest fires that much more likely, we are celebrating our independence by igniting explosives hundreds of meters into the sky. Is that how we want the world to see us? As a nation of selfish fools who never get tired of explosive yet are afraid of environmentalism because it may "hurt the economy"?

The fireworks display's conclusion just made the point more self-evident: at the end, an exorbitant amount of fireworks were launched in succession, releasing smoke and pollutants so dense that the grand finale was completely clouded.

At the end, I saw nothing.
