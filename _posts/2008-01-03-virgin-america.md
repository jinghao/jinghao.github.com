How many of you have flown by Virgin America? I had the privilege of doing so this winter, on my way to Las Vegas (don't worry; I'm not gambling), (yes, you can trust me on that), (yes, really), (can I complete my sentence now?), (thank you), and I found the airline remarkably ... different. I mean, most airlines have this prim and proper look and feel about them, very professional, but Virgin America does not seem to have that, or if it does, it has the kind of professionalism that appeals to the young at heart. For example, here is their <a href = "http://youtube.com/watch?v=eyygn8HFTCo"> safety video</a>. Just when you thought you couldn't possibly redesign the safety video, because the instructions are always oh-so-the-same, Virgin America takes it on a whole new spin. Of course, Virgin wouldn't possibly be Virgin without their take on cartoons similar to those on <i>Adult Swim</i>, such as <a href = "http://youtube.com/watch?v=WzmPhTLyEjI">this</a>, <a href = "http://youtube.com/watch?v=NtwYzGukGXs">this</a>, <a href = "http://youtube.com/watch?v=BN74sBuI-zI">this</a>, <a href = "http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZguxhUtfnrY">this</a>, <a href = "http://youtube.com/watch?v=t2pUBEVBEVI">this</a>, <a href = "http://youtube.com/watch?v=XX-XDIe7qNY">oh this too</a>, <a href = "http://youtube.com/watch?v=1VI52skWIgI">perhaps this as well</a>, <a href = "http://youtube.com/watch?v=YCyWo3Ae_6k">maybe this</a>, and apparently <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=hMCD71uiC10">this</a> too, which serve as in-flight entertainment. And <a href = "http://youtube.com/watch?v=QFcIeemjuc8">this</a>.

I'm intrigued, and I'm also blogging here to save you from Jinghao's incessant stream of posts: are there any other companies that go the youth-oriented way that Virgin does? I mean, I <i>know</i> there exist youth-oriented companies, but I'm pretty sure there are other companies/brands/whatever that advertise the way Virgin does. Besides <i>Adult Swim</i>, of course.

On a totally unrelated note, how many of us are actually Virgin Americans? You may interpret that how you will. :P
