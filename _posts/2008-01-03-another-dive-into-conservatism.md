Mike Huckabee--the Republican underdog who [refuses to acknowledge evolution](http://presidentialpolitic.blogspot.com/2007/05/huckabees-evolution-beliefs.html), wants "schools to acknowledge that there are views that are different than evolution," and promises to "[take [America] back to Christ](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071230/ap_on_el_pr/huckabee_religion)"--[won the Iowa caucuses.](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/usa_politics_dc) He better not win the general election--sure, his ancestors may not have evolved, but organisms in general have.

In other news, Edwards manages to tie with Clinton at 32%, both slightly under Obama's 33%. This time 'round, politics is confusing.
