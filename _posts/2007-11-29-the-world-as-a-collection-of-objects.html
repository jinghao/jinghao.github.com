While we were discussing when to do our group project together:
<blockquote>(04:58:52 PM) Me: but don't worry; I'll come back with enough time to do my part
(04:59:01 PM) Me: nothing stands in the way between me and my code :P
(04:59:09 PM) John W: woot
(04:59:13 PM) John W: spoken like a true nerd
(04:59:27 PM) John W: forget girls
(04:59:37 PM) John W: all i need is a compiler *snort*
(04:59:48 PM) Me: because you can just compile girls into existence?
(04:59:56 PM) Me: Wish I could just define a class and change the specifications as I wish
(05:00:15 PM) John W: wait, objectify girls?
(05:00:17 PM) Me: and instantiate as many objects out of that class as I want
(05:00:33 PM) Me: $girl1 = new Girl();
(05:00:49 PM) Me: $girl1->setAttribute("height", new Measurement(randomInt(155, 175), "cm"));
(05:01:10 PM) Me: $girl1->setAttribute("favoriteFood", new Food("Curry"));
(05:01:45 PM) Me: $girl1->solve(new DifferentialEquation("dy/dx=y+kx"));
(05:01:47 PM) Me: LOL
(05:01:53 PM) Me: the last one would be awesome
(05:03:17 PM) Me: the world as a collection of objects :)
(05:03:39 PM) Me: You're a JAVA guy; you should appreciate it
(05:03:56 PM) John W: ...we are not having this conversation.</blockquote>
Yup, if you can't do the last one, just give up being a girl :P (just kidding)
