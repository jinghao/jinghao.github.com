I'd say that I want to know a lot about cows, but I really don't.  In fact, if I knew more about cows, I might actually go into the agribusiness sector instead.  Who knows, is there still a lot of money to make off of selling cows to huge multinational conglomerates who own the cattle sector?  I really couldn't care less, just like the rest of the American populace, who would rather eat beef than talk about bovines.  But really, let's look into the knowledge of Americans, or really, in our case, the lack thereof.

Americans are intelligent, but up to a certain point.  We know our sports scores, our women, and we absolutely love our cars.  We know little about China, how Newton's laws of mechanics work and where even our damned country is.  So what do we know about cows?  Well for starters, we know that they provide milk for the lot of us, or even milk on top of coffee.  They provide us with the hamburger patties (they here, being literally they because more than one cow goes into a hamburger -- read <i>Fast Food Nation</i> for more details on that one) and they give us great freeway viewing when there is nothing else to look at.  Me?  I know they have six stomachs, chew cud, and provide me with the wholesome milk that I need every morning to grow.  You know, I used to drink milk from Berkeley Farms.

There are farms in Berkeley?!
