[A NYT columnist argues](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/online-backups-could-use-googles-expertise/) that it makes strategic sense for Google to offer an online _backup_ solution to compete with Symantec or EMC because it would be a natural progression for the Internet behemoth.

I disagree. As part of the Chrome OS initiative, Google will offer cloud computing and STORAGE, which are implicitly backed up by Google's GFS. What business sense is there to developing and managing desktop backup software and cloud integration when they can use those resources to further their cloud computing (Essentially CPU-time as a service) goals?

Google has a direction, and it's not pointed at backup.
