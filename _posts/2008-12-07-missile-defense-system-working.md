Apparently the [Pentagon thinks so](http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/12/05/us.missile.test/). Their thinking is "there exists a missile that has been successfully shot down by the MDS" implies "the MDS is working." Shouldn't it be "the MDS is not working" implies "there exists a missile that has not been successfully shot down by the MDS"?

I don't see how we can't produce a guaranteed-to-be-working system after several decades and 100 billion dollars for research (more if the construction begins). It can't be <em>that</em> hard, can it? Worst case scenario: we just set up laser guns along our coast, and aim those at incoming missiles. Then it would be even easier--just a few applications of your high-school trigonometry and you're all set, provided the laser is powerful enough.

There's nothing wrong with the idea of a missile defense system; a working one gives us enormous leverage over rogue nations like Iran. It's just that most of the money appears to be squandered. Obama said he will cut MDS if it doesn't prove itself--this sounds like the Pentagon is trying desperately to keep the MDS (funding) by giving us a false sense of security.
