That is such a stupid website. It tries to explain why "people live[d] longer BEFORE Noah's Flood than ... after it":
<blockquote>After the flood the earth was completely different than the earth before. There were widespread global differences. These would include changes in the climate, composition of the atmosphere, hydrologic cycle, geologic features, cosmic radiation reaching the earth, ozone concentration, ultra violet light, background radiation, genetics, diet, and a host of other subtle and/or profound chemical and physiological changes. These changes caused a rapid decline of the longevity of post flood humanity.</blockquote>
So... that would make people live 10 times less? I doubt it. And they didn't exactly have the world's best diet either. What profound chemical changes? If you don't believe in evolution, how can you believe in chemistry? Cosmic radiation? As if we didn't have radiation before the "flood". Background radiation? Do you even know what it means? It's the remnant radiation from the big bang. I guess you just accepted the fact that <i>the universe was created in the "big bang"</i> tens of billions of years ago (yes, the figure is more than your five-thousand-year estimate).

You claim that "many ancient historians state that the pre-flood inhabitants had long life spans." When did we get accurate records from historians who did not have the facility of writing? You continue to humiliate yourself by declaring that "if you take the points of the population in question and graph them you can see how close the actual decay rate or curve fits the exponential decay curve; this will yield an equation and a value that is called the coefficient of determination:"

Funny. I hope this whole thing was a joke because it caused me to laugh more than I usually do.
