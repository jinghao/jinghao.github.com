If you aren't aware, there was recently a proof published by a researcher at HP Labs that asserted that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">P != NP</a>. Although I did not give anything more than a cursory glance at the paper, I know (from summaries) that it leverages principles from physics.

I can leverage something unrelated to complexity theory to prove that P = NP! Suppose we take some NP-complete problem R. Let's assume that there are a finite number of particles in the universe--upper bounded by something incredibly unreal like 10<exp>50</exp>; and let's assume that there is a finite amount of time in the universe--also upper bounded by something unreal like 10<exp>50</exp> years.

Then there exists a constant K such that no instance of R exceeds K in time. Therefore, R is upper-bounded by K--perhaps the number of years of the universe. Since all NP-complete problems can be reduced to each other, we have proven that all NP-complete problems are bounded by K (or some constant factor of it). Since, with large enough inputs, both a problem in P and NP are upper bounded by the same "universal constant".

Since there is one thing that bounds both classes of problems, they are equivalent. Therefore, P = NP.
