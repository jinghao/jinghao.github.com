I got this via email from my EECS department:
<blockquote>ENGINEER

Type:  Full Time Entry Level
<strong>Wage:  75,000</strong>
Start:   6/1/2007
Openings:  2
Location:  New York, NY
<strong>Hours:  40-50 hours/week</strong>

Company Description
G2 Systems, LLC is a computer engineering consulting firm focused on
providing solutions for the financial services industry. We specialize
in systems deployment and integration, but we can also advise our
clients on systems purchases. Our principals have extensive experience
in both finance and information technology. When we advise on systems
selection, it is with a strict vendor-neutral approach.

Job Qualifications
BSCS or equivalent engineering/science degree. No experience needed.
Programming and Computer Science knowledge preferred.

Job Description
We will have two openings in the New York City area for engineers to
assist with integration solutions for several tri-state area clients.
The work will require the design and implementation of systems software
to move business data between various systems. We are looking to find a
creative, problem solver who can think about problems from multiple
angles and permit the clients to make optimal use of their software systems.</blockquote>
Wages are hourly rates; salaries are annual rates. If I'm expected to earn a wage of $75,000 working 40-50 hours a week, that's 3-3.75 million dollars a week, 13-16.3 million dollars a month, and 156-195 million dollars a year. That's more than what any Silicon Valley executive made in the past few years (minus stock options).

I suppose the wage could have been listed in the Japanese Yen or the Korean Won, which trade at 105 to 1 and 1000 to 1, respectively. But why would they use Asian currencies when they're based in NYC?
