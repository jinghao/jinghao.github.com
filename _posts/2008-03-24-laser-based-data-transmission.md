Sun Microsystems got a grant from DARPA to experiment with [laser-based data transmission](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/24/technology/24wafer.html), a high risk program; Run Ho, "one of the leaders of the effort, ... expects a 50 percent chance of failure." Those of us who have taken some physics (anything with an introduction to relativity) are aware that light, like anything else, can be bent by gravity. What if we equip rockets with chips linked together in this way and the extra g-force bends the laser just enough (say, one millionth of a radian) to disrupt the transmission?

Do I see an imminent disaster or would the gravitational lensing (on a much smaller scale, of course) be too minute to affect things?
