In response to the [Microsoft initiative to explore the educational link to video games](http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_11748201) (basically justifying addiction to World of Warcraft because it "can encourage scientific thinking"), a junior at Fargo South High School claimed that "I've played a lot of puzzle-solving games and they actually help sharpen my brain," which by itself could be a respectable claim.

Then he continued: "My **reaction time** has actually gone **up**, thanks to playing video games." Somehow I doubt that those games sharpened her brain. I laughed when I picked up the irony of the statement.
