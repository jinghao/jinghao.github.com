Behold! When I was walking to class one morning, I suddenly noticed that the logo Cal is in "Electri<strong>cal</strong> Equipment". This is just a rough draft. If you want something like this, do suggest changes and if I see enough demand, I'll put it on Cafepress or something.

I admit, if I just did Electrical Engineering, I would get better alignment but EECS is one whole entity--we cannot alienate the more important half of this joint-major program.
