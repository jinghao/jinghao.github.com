U.C. Berkeley's Haas School of Business moved down from third to 11th according to <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_10/b4074049186360.htm" rel="external">BusinessWeek's list of "Best Undergraduate Business Schools."</a> Oh well. Maybe that means they'll have lower standards for those who apply this fall.
