According to the [NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/business/30golden.html), "Medicare rents [Oxygen equipment] for 36 months before patients take ownership, and pays for a variety of services that critics say are often unnecessary", causing the cost to taxpayers to amount to over double the market price--$8,280 per patient. This is certainly not an anomaly: "Last year Medicare spent more than $21 million on pumps to help older and disabled men attain erections, paying about $450 for the same device that is available online for as little as $108. Even for a simple walking cane, which can be purchased online for about $11, the government pays $20, according to government data." (Why we taxpayers pay hundreds millions of dollars (more) to help disabled men attain erections is beyond me)

If this is consistent throughout government agencies--overspending for things or services that can be attained for a fraction of the price paid at market value--then we can probably cut government spending by over half. After paying off the debt and accumulating a small surplus, taxes can definitely be lowered on the most productive Americans. We can probably save even more money if we cut funding for marginal "benefits" such as erection-inducers for disabled people.

So who supports me? Or do you all need government help for that? <_<
