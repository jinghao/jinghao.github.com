The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7839075.stm">BBC</a> reported that due to the war in Gaza, (1) "at least 1,300 Palestinians were killed, nearly a third of them children, and 5,500 injured"; (2) "4,100 homes were totally destroyed and 17,000 others damaged"; (3) "the overall physical damage so far amounted to about $1.9bn". It contrasted that with the misfortune of an Israeli man who "was shot and seriously wounded while driving in the West Bank." Funny how fair reporting works!
