Not really, but they seem to be targeting us students who are entering finals weeks. I have two papers due in a day, a book to read before writing the papers (<em>Moby Dick</em> is 1047 pages long!), lectures to catch up on--and of course, all my finals this weekend and next week. Just to make it worse, my health isn't at its best.

Yet Woot.com has been having a Woot-off since Tuesday. Gah, I hate them for torturing me!
