Alan Greenspan <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSTRE5881R720090909">attempts to salvage his legacy</a> by claiming that "another global financial crisis is inevitable because human nature always reverts to 'speculative excesses'," implying that the violent bubble that formed under his guidance was inevitable and not his fault.

I suppose it's also "human nature" to defend your legacy.
