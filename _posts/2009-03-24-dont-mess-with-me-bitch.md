Today I decided to run around the block (I felt cold and lazy) when a small dog (the size of an ordinary kitten) started chasing me, barking wildly. I tried sprinting away, but I realized I was getting tired so I turned around and practiced my half-semester of Tae Kwon Do on it. Now it's in the middle of the street. I hope the owners don't find me. I was wearing shorts so I was scared it'd bite me. Now I'm back at home. Is this the right time to say FML?
