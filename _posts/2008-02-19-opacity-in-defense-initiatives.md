In response to President Bush's order for the Navy to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL16451297" rel="external">shoot down a 5000-pound satellite</a>, Russia's Defence Ministry claimed that it "could be used as a cover to test a new space weapon": "Under cover of discussions about the danger posed by the satellite, preparation is going ahead for tests of an anti-satellite weapon. Such tests mean in essence the creation of a new strategic weapon." However, despite fervently criticizing China for doing the same thing, U.S. officials denied accusations of "some space and security experts [who] have said they did not believe Washington's justification for the plans and argued the Pentagon was more likely testing its ability to target other states' satellites."
