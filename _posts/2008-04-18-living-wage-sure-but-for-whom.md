All of the discussion on living wages for U.C. workers focus on whether they <em>deserve</em> to be paid living wages--but the <em>market for labor</em> (supply and demand) determines what they deserve. We simply do not <em>need</em> any more U.C. workers (by which I mean the cafeteria servers, not the professors) at their current wage because (a) we (the students) are already facing incredible cost increases, (b) the U.C. budgets are being reduced as the state government continues to struggle with the deficit and (c) the workers are just too inefficient--much more can be done with fewer of them, if only given a better management.

When there's no need, why should we pay them more? As it stands, the more we pay some of them, the fewer of them we will hire (which may be a good thing for us, but ultimately is bad for those who are clamoring for wage raises). How do they know that their jobs aren't the ones slated for elimination if budget cuts or wage increases force that decision? Is it fair for one worker to receive a raise while another equally-qualified one is left with nothing but his social-security checks, if even that? That's essentially what they are advocating.

Efficiency is certainly a problem in the U.C. system. The solution is not to pay people more to be inefficient and charge students more for that disservice. Instead, we must encourage U.C. workers to be more efficient (meaning we need better management, especially in the chaotic cafeterias) and reward them for making that adjustment.
