I ordered THREE <a href="http://www.woot.com/Blog/BlogEntry.aspx?BlogEntryId=3404" rel="external">miniature train sets</a> midnight. I hope they aren't covered with lead paint.

EDIT: Oh goody. Looks like they're not on the <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/category/toy.html" rel="external">list of toy hazard recalls compiled by the consumer product safety commission.</a>
