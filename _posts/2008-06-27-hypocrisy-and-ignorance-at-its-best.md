According to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/27/us/27solar.html" rel="external">NYT</a>, "the federal government has placed a moratorium on new solar projects ... <em>until it studies their environmental impact</em>, which is expected to take about <em>two years</em>." Understandably, "the decision to freeze new solar proposals temporarily, reached late last month, has caused widespread concern in the alternative-energy industry, as fledgling solar companies must wait to see if they can realize their hopes of harnessing power from swaths of sun-baked public land, just as the demand for viable alternative energy is accelerating." 

This doesn't even make sense. At a time of accelerating growth like this, public assistance is absolutely crucial to a sustainable and fast growth in the industry. And plus, why are we delaying solar projects to study the environmental impact of solar when we know that coal and oil are so much worse?

American congressmen, you fail.
