What does it say when a woman was willing to walk <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080324/od_afp/bhutanvoteoffbeat">600 KM (380 miles)</a> to cast her ballot in the historic Bhutan election, while some of us eligible-to-vote Americans are too lazy to <b>drive 1/10th</b> of that to cast a ballot in our own neighborhood?  That's courage, and democracy for you.
