Paleontologists unearthed "a weird dinosaur with rows of tiny teeth crammed into the very front of its jaws and almost translucent skull bones"--which lived "like a <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-11/16/content_7086534.htm" rel="external"><em>Mesozoic cow</em></a>"--and have named the 110 million-year-old sauropod dinosaur "Nigersaurus Taqueti," after the country in which it was found. Paul Sereno at the University of Chicago commented that "we were blindsided and missed the cows of the Mesozoic." Isn't scientific discovery great?
