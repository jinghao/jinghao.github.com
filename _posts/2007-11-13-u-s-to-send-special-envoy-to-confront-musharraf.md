The Bush administration is "[dispatching a high-level envoy to Pakistan](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/13/washington/13policy.html)" to confront the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and question "whether [proposed] elections could be legitimate." A senior administration official said that "it remained an open question whether free elections could be held that reflected the true wishes of the Pakistani people." Wait, how did this administration get into the White House in the first place, again? Oh yeah, because the Supreme Court said he could. Well, Musharraf is building a stronghold of political allies in Pakistan's supreme court--therefore, his planned election will be just as legitimate as Bush's election.

Doesn't the United States have more important things to do than to highlight its own hypocrisy by questioning others' legitimacy?
