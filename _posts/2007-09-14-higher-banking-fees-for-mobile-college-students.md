Well, ladies and gentlemen, be prepared for higher banking fees. This summer, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,296699,00.html" target="_blank">Bank of America boosted its ATM fee nationwide</a> to $3 for "non-bank customers." It appears as though food and energy prices aren't the only inflation indices that are shooting through the roof. On the other hand, if you have a Bank of America account you use frequently, you can relish in the convenience and wide availability of its ATMs, and at the same time laugh at your friends who don't (ha ha, Wa-Mu!).
