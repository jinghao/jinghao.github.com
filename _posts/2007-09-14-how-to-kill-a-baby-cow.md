This obviously does not relate at all to Berkeley, but since this IS The Daily Cow, I thought I might share the results of my research into cow killing.

According to <a href="http://www.notmilk.com/killacalf.html" target="_blank">this document</a>, "the easiest way to kill a baby male calf is to separate him from his mother, then drag the thrashing infant to a ditch and shoot him in the brain with your gun." That made me wonder--why would you want to kill a baby calf? Well, the same document makes that reason explicit. It explains that "calves are born ...to keep their moms producing milk," and that if the "calves are unlucky enough to be born male, feed costs no longer justify raising these darling creatures for veal."

That's all I'm going to say today about the topic of cow-killing. For those of you with an insatiable quantity of "curiosity" (or sadism), I leave you with the document webpage to investigate this matter further (by yourself). Enjoy, fellow cow-lovers.
