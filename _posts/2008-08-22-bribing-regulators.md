United States had decided to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/business/worldbusiness/22fobriefs-DUTIESTOEND_BRF.html" rel="external">end punitive duties</a> imposed on Hynix Semiconductors, a South Korean company, in 2003, possibly with the intention of winning the favors of South Korean regulators who are considering the monopolistic practices of Intel Corporation, America's very own semiconductor company. I wonder if anyone else thinks that is a reason for their reversal.
