There used to be a time when the internet was a nice place to be.  The world wide web used to be small, innocent, and quite easy to maneuver.  Nowadays, the situation is much different.  Instead of being able to navigate easily, our webpages are clouded with ads that are completely irrelevant to what we want.

In adding on to Jinghao's [post](http://dailycow.org/node/308), I rarely click ads, if at all.  Its more for amusement than anything else, but even then, when I want to read something, I want to be able to access it without having my browser load at five times slower.  If I want to see something, I'll go find it myself.  And ad might help, but probably less than 1/10th of the time.  Hence, I run AdBlock plus.

And no, not even Google gets my love.
