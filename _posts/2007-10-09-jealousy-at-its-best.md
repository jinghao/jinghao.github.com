"A self-professed art lover" was [thrown into court Tuesday](http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=oddlyEnoughNews&storyid=2007-10-09T160328Z_01_L09121116_RTRUKOC_0_US-FRANCE-ART-KISS.xml) for committing the "savagery" of "damaging a $2-million painting by kissing it while wearing red lipstick" because she was ostensibly "overcome with passion." In response, the deputy prosecutor "demanded the court fine her 4,500 euros ($6,320)." Additionally, the picture's owner, Yvon Lambert, "wants $2 million in damages and a further 33,400 euros that he says is needed to pay for the restoration work."

Clearly, someone was "overcome by an emotion that she could not tame"--namely Jealousy that the wildly-decorated canvas was worth more than her house--and alleviated the emotion by desecrating the picture with red lipstick.
