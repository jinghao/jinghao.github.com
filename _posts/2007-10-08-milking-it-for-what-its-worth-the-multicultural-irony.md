Santa Clara University's (SCU) Multicultural Center (MCC) is a multicultural irony.  Consider the following:

- The MCC here on campus is assumed to be open to all cultures and ethnicities, yet on a consistent basis, it rejects others from trying to learn more.  Case in point:  During MCC Open House, while minorities are greeted with welcome, whites (60% of SCU) are repeatedly given the shunning look, and stared at for an apparent misplacement on campus.  Open to everyone?  You decide.

- SCU's MCC on campus is consumed with itself.  When a member of the Chinese Student's Association (CSA) is clearly far more dedicated and attends far more meetings than the opposer, the opposer, who has not shown up at all to the meeting, wins after interviews by the officer.  Coincidence?  Apparently not, as the President of CSA at the time is the friend with this person.  Just check their facebook wall-to-wall.

- SCU's MCC thrives on inner corruption, especially when it comes to a club such as CSA.  When faced with the situation of expanding, the main issue is marketing.  Talk about Chinese issues?  Nah.  Why?  Oh, because we'll have less members.  Oh really, why is that?  Maybe it's because you're badmouthing the members while you're at it, and maybe because you just don't care because you're Taiwanese and America will always back you.  And tell me, why is the PR Chair Japanese?  Oh, maybe because she happens to be popular, good looking, and does a great jigglypuff impression.  Couldn't find the Japanese Student Association, could she?

These three points are just a few of the many points that culminate in the theory of multicultural irony of SCU.  It's truly tragic, in every sense, but when I observe, it feels like these students who run the MCC have not deviated from their parental desires of staying within the culture.  They only hang out with their own culture, and it's obvious, while they reject others.  Having been on the inside as an officer of CSA, the organization is dripping from corruption like cheese drips from a good hamburger -- it's creating a stain on the general nucleus of the university.  If anyone is interested at all to why the MCC fails to garner any general student support, they only need to look to these points and understand the true cultural irony and catastrophe.  By creating an implied exclusionary policy that negates the hoping influence of anyone interested in culture, and an ignorance to one's beliefs and one's impacts on their culture, they set themselves up for failure.  Ever wonder why I dislike the Taiwanese?  This is one of the reasons -- at least in the Santa Clara University sense, where status quo issues and general Asian American issues are ignored, it befuddles the mind and leaves me wondering.
