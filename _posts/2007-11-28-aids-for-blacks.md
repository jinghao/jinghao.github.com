According to [The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/26/AR2007112601153.html), "more than 80 percent of the [new] HIV cases identified between 2001 and 2006 were among black men, women and adolescents"--even more striking is the fact that, "among women who tested positive, a rising percentage of local cases, nine of 10 were African American." So remind me again why Africa has the world's highest HIV-infection rates? Maybe Dr. Watson can give us the explanation.
