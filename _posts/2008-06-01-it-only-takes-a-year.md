<strong>Ms. J:</strong> Jinghao, you've become much more confident and happy with yourself over the past year. You're still as quirky and energetic as before, but you've become much more mature and comfortable.
<strong>Me:</strong> Really? I think it's because my mom used to remind me that I'm fat, but now I'm away at college where nobody cares.
