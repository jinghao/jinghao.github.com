Albert here; feature columnist of The Daily Cow.

I'm not sure how much I know about the nature of bovines. They have more than five stomachs, moo, and give us quality beef as well as nice milk. But other than cows, there isn't much to say besides the fact that they have been big in news because of their involvement in many disease-ridden scandals, such as foot and mouth disease. Of course, it always helps that the cow is also quite protected by our friends of the right-winged Republican Party.

I won't try to get political.

But more about me: I go to Santa Clara University, not the University of California at Berkeley.  I however, know the owner of this site, Jinghao, who has graciously given me a space to discuss the existence of these four legged friends that we so depend on for the milk in our cereal, the patty in our hamburger, or the beef in our dinner -- It is after all, cows that that make up a lot of our daily lives, and I hope to somehow talk about them.  George W. Bush, our commander in chief is now cow, but that is another story.  Anyway, I hope to provide a different angle on this whole blog by providing a private school point of view; although it will probably be devoid of Catholic ideology, as I am not. Cows? There are none around SCU. Maybe I will engage in debates with the other columnists here. I don't know.

What I am concerned with right now is finding a rightful name for this blog of mine.  Several ideas come to mind.  Coward is a word for example.  Cows aren't cowards however.  They are just victims of an industry they never volunteered to join.  Yeah.  Right.   I think I'll just be <b>Milking it for what it's worth</b>.

Hm, novel idea!

Good day!
