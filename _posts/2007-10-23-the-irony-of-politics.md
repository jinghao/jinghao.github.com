President Bush "[asked lawmakers for $46 billion more" than the original budget "to pay for overseas military operations and insisted that they approve it by the end of the year](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/22/AR2007102202144.html)" less than a month after rejecting uninsured children [subsidized health insurance](http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h3-r4-QX2sJIwxAkeLfY3zUOHgQAD8SD5KK00), which costs only $30 billion more than the current system over five years--significantly less than the request for Iraq. Isn't it strange that Bush is asking for money to fund a killing machine while he is insistent on keeping uninsured children uninsured (which undoubtedly puts all those around them in risk)?
