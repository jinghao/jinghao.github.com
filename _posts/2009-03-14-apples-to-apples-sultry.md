I was playing Apples to Apples with a bunch of people today as part of the "Pi Day Celebrations" and it was my turn to be the judge, and the adjective (the green card) was "sultry."

The submissions at first weren't all that interesting (I mean, Rosie O'Donnell? WTF?), then I saw "Giant Squid," to which I remarked "Oh, I suppose they do have eight flexible tentacles..." and everyone burst out laughing. Due to popular consent I let that one win.

Now everyone thinks I'm a kinky pervert who has a fetish for seafood (food for sperm whales). (This might be the appropriate place for me to say FML)
