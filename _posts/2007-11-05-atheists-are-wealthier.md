<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/03/technology/03online.html" target="_blank">A global research recently conducted by the Pew Research Center</a> demonstrated that there is "a strong relationship between a countryâ€™s religiosity and its economic status" because "the poorer a country, the more religion remains central to the lives of individuals," with the United States being the "most notable" exception.

This reminds me of <a href="http://originxt.com/node/15202" target="_blank">my argument that religion holds back productivity</a>. If people will print and distribute free copies of <em>The Origin of Species</em> instead of <em>The Bible</em>, more people will be brought out of ignorance. But we all know that's an unrealistic aspiration.

Just a disclaimer: I don't worship bovines, although other contributors will have to attest to their "affiliations" for themselves.
