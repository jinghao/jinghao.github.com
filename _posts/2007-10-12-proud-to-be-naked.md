DISCLAIMER: This is not meant to be a scientic analysis of speciation.

Now that I have your attention, I have a question to ask: Why is it that a human is the only organism that wears artificial coverings? How often do you see other animals decorated with long-sleeved leather jackets and rabbit-fur? Only if the owner is some freak or if the animal is a cow or a rabbit, right? So why are we the only strange animals on this planet?

Perhaps it's a tool that enables us to become the most adaptive inhabitants on this planet; there are Inuits living in the Arctic Circle and refugees in Darfur, and you certainly don't see polar bears (naturally, or not in zoos) in Africa, nor do you see elephants in Alaska. That makes me wonder: if we humans never discovered the virtue of clothing, would we still be stuck in Africa, trapped as (African) elephants are on the continent? Or would we have separated into distinct species, each fit for its own habitat, just as bears have?

I don't know, but it's good to have clothes. Yay, summer-heat. Yay, winter-snow (well, not really).

As we can see, the development of clothing and other forms of artificial protection was purely prudential. So, why do [people care about clothing-penetrating security scans that completely anonymize the person being scanned?](http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=202401630)
