Beware:
<blockquote>Jay: I'm watching a low quality version of the new Batman. The joker's got some pretty cool ideas. He has a set S of people who help him rob a bank, and each person S<sub>i</sub> has a specific role, which is executed in order (i=0 being done first), and member S<sub>i+1</sub> is told to kill S<sub>i</sub> after S<sub>i</sub> completes his role.</blockquote>
Iteration is awesome.

<code><pre>for (int i = 0; i < S.length - 1; i++) {
    S[i].doStuff();
    S[i + 1].kill(S[i]);
}</pre></code>
