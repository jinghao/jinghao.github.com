So Aristotle thinks there's logical justification for the existence of "divine understanding" (basically "god" for him). But his "logical justification" for his vision of the divine is just as valid as his "logical justification" for his theses on Physics (His "arguments" absolutely fail when one considers modern-day robots as counter-examples) and Cosmology (Earth at center, orbited by spheres containing stars, etc).

But I guess his "divine understanding" is not like the Judeo-Christian God because "divine understanding" is just the "understanding of understanding". Isn't that great?
