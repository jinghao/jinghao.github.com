It would be:

1. 300 billion dollars to states, $1000 for each resident, with up to that much more at the Treasury rate, and insure state debt for 10 years. Let the states pay for education with this money
1. 200 billion dollars for infrastructure development: High speed rail, subway systems, upgrading/fixing bridges, modernized bus systems
1. 50 billion dollars for health: Modernization of infrastructure and preventive care (immunizations, etc)
1. 50 billion dollars for alternative energy research/production subsidies
1. 50 billion dollars for miscellaneous projects (WiMax for rural areas, for example) that promote equity and efficiency, not pet projects that benefit only very specific people (No pork)

As you notice, that's somewhat less than the stimulus we have in place today and contains no tax cuts.
