NAND flash memory has become a commodity. The chips are selling for less than average-cost, and memory-chip makers are losing money. Almost any company that licenses the technology can produce and sell it. There is virtually nothing differentiating SD cards from different manufacturers.

In fact, recently I saw that Woot.com was offering two 2GB MicroSD cards (with adapters) for 6.50 (nevermind shipping), but I thought nothing of the brand because I know that all MicroSD cards are the same size and will do the same things.

If we take a look at a specific company, we will see that SanDisk had a terrible quarter, and understandably its stock is down nearly 80% since its recent peak just last summer. But I noticed something interesting about it: It collects a lot of money just from royalty alone.

Samsung alone pays SanDisk [500 million dollars annually](http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2008/09/08/daily9.html). There are numerous other memory chip makers who probably also pay royalties. Since SanDisk collects anywhere from 500 million to a billion (or more) dollars a year from royalties, wouldn't it make more sense to restructure in the following way?

First, stop making and developing flash memory chips that are unprofitable; the market is already highly saturated. This will cut costs significantly.

But you ask: SanDisk makes flash memory--what does it mean to stop making flash memory chips? It means that it should develop more profitable and growth-packed markets: Solid State Drives (SSDs), the future of personal storage. SSDs are compact, light, energy-efficient, silent, fast, and highly reliable. The two reasons why SSDs do not sell more than regular hard drives is that SSDs are expensive and they come in limited quantities and capacities. This is what SanDisk needs to address.

How will it have the money to operate in the mean time? Just keep collecting royalties, liquidate its inventories, and slim down the organization of the company. In fact, this alone will be better than what it does now. 500+ million dollars annually is better than what it earns now. In fact, it's so good that it can pay hefty dividends, repay some debt, buy back stock and still have money left over each quarter.

So why doesn't SanDisk do this? Exiting a saturated market makes good business sense since it cannot manage its costs.
