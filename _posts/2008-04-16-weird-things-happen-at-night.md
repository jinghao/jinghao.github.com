Well, besides that and the obvious, interesting conversations begin at the early hours of the night (12 AM, for example). Here's one. Prepare to be omgwtf'ed.
<blockquote>[Insert conversation about the possibility of the existence of friendly and sentient beings somewhere out there]

Me: why are you asking me about aliens?
Jonathan: to see what a fellow scientist thinks about the subject
Jonathan: late at night my mind wanders
Me: I thought late at night your mind wanders somewhere else, like into someone's pants
Jonathan: well, yes, but that is not the point
Me: so you're into aliens now
Jonathan: into sentience
Jonathan: into ... many things
Me: into your mom
Jonathan: *hangs head*
Jonathan: I do suppose that getting a straight answer out of you is impossible
Me: hence, you caused yourself to be born!
Me: infinite recursion!
Me: stack trace overflow!
Me: crash!
Me: memory buffer overrun!
Me: boom!
Me: oh, by the way, that's what she said
Jonathan: ok, so, I'm not talking to you any more tonight</blockquote>
