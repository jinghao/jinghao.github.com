I'm often stopped in my daily thoughts to wonder about the meaning of life.  Why do we go to school?  Why do we fall in love?  Why do we bother when all that happens in the end is that we die, and just go back into the ground (and maybe go somewhere else?).

An answer to this question will probably never be found for me, but the getting to the answer lies in the everyday struggle to live.  In reading the vignettes that Tricia and Jinghao provide today, I believe my will to live lies in the everyday struggle -- the struggle to love, the struggle to succeed and the struggle to become a better person.  I will never reach the apex of this, but knowing that an increase in potential and ability is something that is worth living for.

The other part of life that I look for is the beauty.  The beauty keeps me inspired.
