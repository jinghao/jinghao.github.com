Overpowered in policy and influence by Congress, President Bush is now focusing on "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/washington/24bush.html" rel="external">kitchen table issues</a>," and as a result, he is using his veto powers more frequently because thatâ€™s one way to ensure that [Bush is] relevant." Too bad he's vetoing the wrong things, such as Children's health care and water system renovation projects.
