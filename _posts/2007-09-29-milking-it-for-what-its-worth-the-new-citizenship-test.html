Until I read Jinghao's article below, I did not know that it cost $675 to become an American citizen.  However high that may be, I don't think it lessens incentive for those who want to become American citizens anyhow.  People from all over have such a desire to come and experience the freedoms that the USA offers.  Granted, the roads are not paved in gold, but likewise, people want to work for the higher comparative wages.  As my aunt in China told me -- "China is the 3rd World Country, and America is the 1st world... everyone wants to go to America..."

The thing I wonder about is, would be the new test that immigrants are now required to take.  According to the article that Jinghao cites below, 84% of the applicants passed on the old one, compared with 94% on the new one.  So it's not anymore harder than the old one, but what I wonder is:  Can Americans themselves even pass the new one?  Southerners still think that they won the civil war, a little less than half the US can identify where France is and a beauty pageant contestant in North Carolina thinks that Americans are horrible at geography because well... not all of us can afford maps.

So what makes you think that the average joe would remember who we fought in the American Revolution?  I mean, take a look at question 67...

<blockquote>"The Federalist Papers supported the passage of the U.S. Constitution. Name one of the writers."</blockquote>

For me, the person who absolutely loved US History AP, this question requires a bit of thought on my part.  My answer in this case would be Alexander Hamilton or Thomas Jefferson, but even then, I am not too sure about this answer. 

So the bottom line really is not whether immigrants can answer these questions or not, it's more like whether American citizens can.  And what do I think?  I think that they can't, and that this new test is an example of the conservative agenda that President George W. Bush has been trying to push since he entered office.  After all, if we can find one more loophole to prevent that Indian entrepreneur from coming over to help us innovate, then why not reject him, right? And really, if less than 1/3 of Americans can find critical geographic points on the map, what makes you think that they can tell you who helped write the Federalist papers?
