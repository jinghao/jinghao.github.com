Japan's legislature proposed another [stimulus package](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7641164.stm) with the intent of boosting the economy and hence tax revenues. Actually, I highly doubt this will help Japan deal with its immense public debt, which is [TWICE (200%) the size of its GDP](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/ja.html). Perhaps spending their way out of debt isn't going to work.
