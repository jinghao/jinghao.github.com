It's what got us here. People continuously adapt to changing environments and new platforms. In one example, <a href="http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/03/sweetest-tweet.html" rel="external">these people</a> proposed on Twitter (apparently for everyone to see), and fortunately for them, the responses were in the affirmative. What if they were not?

Man: "@Woman: blah blah blah will you marry me? blah blah blah"
Woman: "@Man: Uh, everyone knows that a REAL man gets down to his knees to propose! Go find another lady."
Man: "Hm, list entry one, cross off. @ Woman 2: blah blah blah will you marry me? blah blah blah"
Woman: "@Man: Hell yeah!"
