Or does it? In response to an [updated report that depicted a decline in HIV infections](http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-aids20nov20,0,4239134.story?page=1&coll=la-home-center), Dr. James Chin of UC Berkeley, "a former WHO AIDS expert who has been tracking the disease since it first emerged in California in the 1980s", claims that UNAIDS has "been overemphasizing and exaggerating numbers in an effort to get more and more money; a lot of people say the ends justify the means. It's going to come back and bite you when the real numbers appear." What do you think?
