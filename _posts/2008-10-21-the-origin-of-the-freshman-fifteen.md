I've always wondered why my school's cafeteria, which professes to offer only healthy food, made me and others fat. Perhaps it was because it packaged <a href="http://services.housing.berkeley.edu/FoodPro/dining/static/label.asp?locationNum=50&locationName=A-Z+Menu+Item+Listing&RecNumAndPort=131051*1">all these nutrients</a> in such an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Ruben_sandwich.jpg">innocuous-looking package</a>.

5000 Calories, 75 grams of fat, 13000 mg of Sodium, 820 grams of carbohydrates, and 321% of the Iron you need--well, to be fair it also has 170 grams of protein.

So who wants it? (I apologize if I ruined your appetite for Crossroads food)
