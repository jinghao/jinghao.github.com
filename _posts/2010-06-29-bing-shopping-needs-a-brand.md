title: Bing Shopping Needs a Brand

Google's shopping website has a brand: Froogle.com. Bing Shopping on the other hand, is just another tab within bing.com. Arguably it is search related--but the focus on shopping is lost.

The solution for Bing is to develop a brand for its shopping website. Instead of bing.com/shopping, it should be Bling. Yes, that's right. Bling.com.

What do you think? The domain currently hosts ads so has no valuable use anyway.
