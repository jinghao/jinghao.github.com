My (paternal) grandma got ran over by <a href="system/files/20071114-115757.bmp">a silver vehicle</a> (or  <a href="system/files/20071114-115758.bmp">this</a> or  <a href="system/files/20071114-115759.bmp">this</a> or <a href="system/files/20071122-175714.bmp">this</a> or <a href="system/files/car.avi">an animated clip of the car</a>).

My dad forwarded me the pictures from my cousin, asking me to decipher the license plate number on the silver car (is that even possible?). When I asked him what the pictures are for, he said my grandma got ran over by a car. That's all I know about this; I don't know how she's doing :(
