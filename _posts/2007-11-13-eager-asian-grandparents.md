Joey: hey [that attractiveness chart](http://dailycow.org/node/99) makes a lot of sense
Me: I can probably place everyone I know somewhere on the graph
Me: usually I find them to be more left-leaning <_<
Joey: left?
Me: above the y=x line
Me: is the graph just for friends of the opposite gender?
Me: because otherwise "relationship temptation" "dating zone" "marriage potential" wouldn't apply to straight men
Me: or f-buddy...especially that.
Joey: yes indeed
Joey: are they in the marriage zone? :P
Me: no
Me: although I might get desperate 10 years from now
Me: my grandparents (who would be almost 100) would scream "WE'RE ABOUT TO DIE AND YOU STILL DON'T HAVE A SON TO SHOW US???"
Joey: LOL
Joey: and then you'll settle for f-buddy?
Me: no
Me: I'd lower the k in y+x=k just a bit
