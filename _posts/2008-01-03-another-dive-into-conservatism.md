Mike Huckabee--the Republican underdog who <a href="http://presidentialpolitic.blogspot.com/2007/05/huckabees-evolution-beliefs.html">refuses to acknowledge evolution</a>, wants "schools to acknowledge that there are views that are different than evolution," and promises to "<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071230/ap_on_el_pr/huckabee_religion" rel="external">take [America] back to Christ</a>"--<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/usa_politics_dc" rel="external">won the Iowa caucuses.</a> He better not win the general election--sure, his ancestors may not have evolved, but organisms in general have.

In other news, Edwards manages to tie with Clinton at 32%, both slightly under Obama's 33%. This time 'round, politics is confusing.
