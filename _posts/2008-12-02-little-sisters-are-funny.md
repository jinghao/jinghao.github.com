Today my sister got home from her middle school and IMed me:
<blockquote>(4:08:19 PM) *Youya*: What does Depression mean?
(4:09:19 PM) *Youya*: It's for my Science HW
(4:09:39 PM) *Jinghao*: when you're really sad
(4:09:51 PM) *Youya*: :( <---like this?</blockquote>
Then she told me about the squirrels that hang out on top of my house and make a lot of noise:
<blockquote>(4:19:18 PM) *Youya*: Dad caught a squirrel
(4:19:26 PM) *Youya*: It's in the backyard in a cage
(4:19:33 PM) *Jinghao*: is he gonna feed it?
(4:19:36 PM) *Youya*: no
(4:19:56 PM) *Youya*: He's going to leave it at a park far from our home so it'll stop going on our house
(4:20:42 PM) *Jinghao*: he only caught one squirrel?
(4:20:52 PM) *Youya*: It's sort of like a mouse-trap without killing it or putting food in it
(4:21:21 PM) *Youya*: He also caught a badger or something
(4:21:23 PM) *Jinghao*: how come the squirrel went to the trap?
(4:21:33 PM) *Youya*: Maybe it was stupid</blockquote>
Edit:
<blockquote>(4:35:37 PM) *Youya*: HEY!!! YOU WROTE ABOUT ME ON DAILYCOW.ORG!!!</blockquote>
