From the 12th problem set of the Discrete Mathematics & Probability class:
<blockquote><strong>Problem 4.</strong> (10 points) A whimsical prison warden has 101 prisoners under his purview. He decides one day that to devise a game: he has an endless supply of red and blue hats. He will go to each prisoner, flip a fair coin, and if it comes up heads, that prisoner gets a red hat, otherwise that prisoner gets a blue hat. The prisoners are allowed to strategize together before the hats are distributed, but once the hats are distributed, there is no communication allowed. Each prisoner can see everyone elseâ€™s hat, but not their own. Each of them must write down on a piece of paper whether there the total number of blue hats (including his own) is even or odd. If at least 51 of the prisoners guess correctly, all the prisoners are set free. Otherwise, they continue their prison sentences as if nothing happened. Can you come up with a strategy for the prisoners that gives them better than a 50% chance of being set free? What is the probability they go free under your strategy?</blockquote>

I wonder if the prisoners can do this: While strategizing prior to being assigned a hat, they decide on some order (so each prisoner is assigned a distinct number 1 through 101). Then after each is assigned a hat, #1 will stand in the middle, and #2 will stand behind #1 if #1 is blue and in front of otherwise. And afterward each prisoner will stand after the last blue and before the first red. In the end we will have b blues and 101-b reds. If the very last person sees red in front of him, then that means he is a red--so he can count exactly how many blues there are. If he sees no red, then he's either a red or a blue. Then he guesses even.

That's hard to explain. Is this cheating though?
