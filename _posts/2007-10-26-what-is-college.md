I went to a course-advising session today to hear current undergraduates applying to Haas talk about their experiences with various professors, courses, and schedules, and to get a few of my and others' questions answered. The whole event was rather useless--I didn't learn anything new outside of the research (on the Haas website) that I had already conducted myself--and the questions others asked were extremely saddening.

It seemed like the only people viewed college as is a black box that takes in work and spits out grades. Their only concerns were "Is this class easy?" "Will I get an A in the class?" "Which professors are the easiest?" "What's the easiest R1A/R1B/Calculus/CS/etc class I can take to satisfy the requirement?" "What's the minimum I have to do to get into Haas?", etc. There was practically no discussion about whether one should choose a specific professor because he was an especially good lecturer or a specific class because it was especially helpful in cultivating your understanding in x, y and z. Instead, the focus was on how easy it is to get an A.

Wanting college only for the grade and name is counterintuitive to the whole purpose of college. When the students asked for "easier" classes, they meant classes whose professors covered less material, with less depth and were lax on other requirements. Certainly the goal of getting into a college with brilliant and well-qualified professors is to avoid them for the "easier" ones--at least, it shouldn't be for Berkeley students; if it were your goal, you should be at a community college. I admit, not all easy professors are bad and not all difficult professors are good (Some, like my mathematics professor, are "difficult" because they lack the lecturing abilities), but that does not justify paying thousands more each year for a superficial education.

College is a place to learn, and you just can't get as much out of "easy" classes as out of slightly more challenging ones. Grades are great, but it's what made those grades that really count. Don't just take a class because it is "easy" and avoid a class just because it is "difficult"; take classes that are interesting and helpful.

If I wanted easy, I would be attending De Anza instead.
