The H1N1 virus (swine flu) scares me. Now that it's within breathing distance of UC Berkeley, I'm scared even more: "A parent of two Malcolm X Elementary School students has been diagnosed with the H1N1 virus, prompting the Berkeley Unified School District to dismiss classes at the school for a week, city officials announced Sunday."

Why do swine-flu infected parents still send their possibly-infected children to infect the world? Why do people who have been in swine-flu hot spots (and aren't feeling well themselves) still travel around the world to spread the disease worldwide? If this mutates into something that has a 3% mortality rate, it will be just the optimal level to spread to everyone in the world. (If mortality rates are too high, it won't spread really fast)

Actually, in Mexico the rate seems higher than 3%. We're screwed.
