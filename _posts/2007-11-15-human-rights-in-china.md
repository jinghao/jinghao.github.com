Is <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=oddlyEnoughNews&storyid=2007-11-14T160904Z_01_N1492029_RTRUKOC_0_US-SEX.xml" rel="external">this</a> what the activists are talking about? The "consumer rights" to see "the on-screen sex and other scenes that director Lee cut himself at the behest of local censors"? Because the "fragmented portrayal of the female lead's psyche makes it hard for the audience to appreciate the movie's art"? I thought suing for "psychological damages" and other trivialities was an American thing.
