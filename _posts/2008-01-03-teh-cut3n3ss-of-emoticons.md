The emoticons I 'invented' (by accident) look cuter if I use commas instead of dots. So that instead of looking like cute kittehs, they look like cute monstars:

^...^ ==> ^,,,^
o...o ==> o,,,o
T...T ==> T,,,T
?...? ==> ?,,,? (I call this the Jon monstar).
$...$ ==> $,,,$ (I call this the Jinghao monstar).

On a totally related note, what emoticon would best describe you? o,,,o"
