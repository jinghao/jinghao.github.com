The U.S. Chamber of Commerce [estimates](http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE49C7EI20081013) that "piracy costs the United States nearly $250 billion annually." Let's do some math on this.

How much do we really pirate? 250 billion dollars annually divided into 80 million American households yields 3125 dollars a year of piracy. Does the average American household pirate over 3000 dollars of stuff a year? Put another way, are there things that you currently pirate that you would pay the full price for if piracy were not an option--that sum up to a value of over 3000 dollars?

I highly doubt it.

Don't get me wrong: I think piracy is bad. I believe in having a strong system for protecting intellectual property. But I don't think flinging around false numbers is the way to do it.
