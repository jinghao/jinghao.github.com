I apologize for the prolonged delay and my failure to uphold the second part of our three-word name. The cause is simple: I had a headache that lasted the whole weekend which had somehow transformed itself into a neckache (wasn't good for the CS midterm...). After some brief research, I've learned the cause was simple: Cow-cium deficiency. Yup, I haven't had enough milk for the past few weeks (none, actually--just a small cup of soymilk a day). I didn't even get a single serving of milk (or soymilk) in any given day.

Obviously this cow-cium deficiency, when extended to over two weeks, begins to cause noticeable symptoms such as headaches, which really are stresses or strains of the head and neck muscles. Yup. Muscles need Cow-cium to remain healthy, and I was depriving them of this wonderful substance.

Interestingly, the day after I went to a local convenience store, purchased a half-gallon carton of milk and drank half of it, my head pains almost went away, and so, here I am, alive and relating my experience with you. Moral of the story? Get tons of milk because cows are the pwn.
