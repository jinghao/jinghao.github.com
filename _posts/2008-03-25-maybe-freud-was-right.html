Be warned: this is sickening. Do not read if you're eating dinner.
<blockquote>DEAR ABBY: I'm a divorced single mother with a 13-year-old daughter I'll call "Gia." We live next door to an attractive 62-year-old widow I'll call "Doris," who has become like a grandmother to Gia and a dear friend to me.

Last night I went to my daughter's room and found her standing on a stool in her closet looking out a small window into Doris' bedroom. When I asked Gia what she was doing, she didn't answer, so I climbed up on the stool to see for myself. Abby, Doris was in bed with her son, "Jeff," having sex. I could hardly believe my eyes!</blockquote>
