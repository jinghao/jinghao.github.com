Actually, energy investors pushed the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7040775.stm" target="_blank">price of crude to $84 for the first time</a> to mock <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7042423.stm" target="_blank">Al Gore and his Nobel Peace Prize</a> for his global warming activism. Ha, ha, funny. Now stop manipulating the price of oil.
