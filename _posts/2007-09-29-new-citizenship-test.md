The Bush administration unveiled a revamped citizenship test Thursday "intended to promote assimilation and patriotism -- a redesign some critics contend erects a higher hurdle for immigrants who want to become citizens." According to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-na-citizenship28sep28,1,6693142.story?coll=la-news-a_section" target="_blank">the Los Angeles Times</a>:
<blockquote>The 100 new civics questions -- which test knowledge of American government, history and civics and take effect Oct. 1, 2008 -- will require less rote memorization and are meant to focus more on fostering identification with American values. For example, applicants may currently be asked, "What country did we fight during the Revolutionary War?" But starting next year, applicants could be asked to explain why the colonists fought the British. They may also have to describe what the "rule of law" is and outline one constitutional amendment concerning the right to vote. (Applicants are asked 10 questions and must answer at least six correctly to pass.)</blockquote>
Apparently, not everyone is satisfied with the changes. According to Fred Tsao, policy director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, "we've always been concerned that <b>people with lower levels of education</b> would have trouble with this new test and people of lower income would not be able to pay for the process. <b>Mexicans ... fall into that category.</b>" Yet, in a statement that obviously contradicts Tsao's concerns, Alfonso Aguilar, chief of the Office of Citizenship, said that while "94% of the volunteers passed the new test, [only] 84% passed the current test."

What do you think about the new citizenship test? Does it better capture the essence of "What it is to be an American", or is it just another complicated barrier for "less-educated" immigrants to overcome?
