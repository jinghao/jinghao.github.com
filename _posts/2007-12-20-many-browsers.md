I have the following installed on my Ubuntu 7.10 x64_86:
<ol>
<li>Elinks</li>
<li>Lynx</li>
<li>Firefox (64 bit)</li>
<li>Firefox (32 bit)</li>
<li>Internet Explorer (with Windows layer--WINE)</li>
<li>Safari for Windows (with WINE on Ubuntu)</li>
<li>Opera Krestel (beta)</li>
<li>And several more on my virtual machines</li>
</ol>
I don't think I need any more browsers.
