Last month, largely due to sharply-increased energy prices, [the Producer Price Index shot up 3.2 percent](http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSN1321490420071213?feedType=nl&feedName=usdai), the fastest monthly gain since August 1973--the start of the Period of Great Stagflation--and was "well ahead of analysts' expectations of a 1.5 percent gain." In fact, the sharp jump in gasoline prices has even pushed up retail sales by a misleadingly positive 1.2 percent, which was "twice the increase Wall Street economists were expecting."

Interestingly, New York Times columnist Bajaj claims that this surge in retail sales is proof that the ["American economy is not going to keel over just yet, after all."](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/business/14econ.html) I don't think it will, either, but using misleading figures to justify that argument is pretty low of a journalist, isn't it?
