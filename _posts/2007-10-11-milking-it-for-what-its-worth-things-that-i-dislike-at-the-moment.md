It's midterm week.  I feel like blabbing a bit.

* I don't like Chemistry.  I have a strange fear for it.

* On the other hand, Accounting makes more sense than ever.  Want to know how Raw Materials becomes part of the Cost of Good Sold on the Income Statement?  I know that.  On the other hand, converting mass to moles takes a bit more brainpower for whatever reason.

* The weekend is close.

I guess that's it for now.  I found this great website on saying "moo" in multiple languages.  I'll post that soon.  It's quite a fun read.
