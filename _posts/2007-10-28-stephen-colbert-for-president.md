Not a chance, although the Facebook group in support of the man got one million members ten times faster than a comparable Obama or Hillary group took to reach a third that number. He just doesn't have the political experience.

Although, if he runs as Hillary's running mate nationwide, I wouldn't be opposed to giving a vice president a job other than tie-breaking--perhaps entertaining? (although I can't really vote)
