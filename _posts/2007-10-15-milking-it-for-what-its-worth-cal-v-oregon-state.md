The last 14 posts have been by Jinghao and I.  The two before that were by Joey.  The few before that were by me and Jinghao, again.  We need some intellectual diversity, here, people!

Anyhow, I'm thinking that No. 2 Cal must be very subdued today.  They cost themselves the No. 1 ranking with a rookie Quarterback who decided to run the football from the 11 yard line with 8 seconds to go, when there were no timeouts to stop the clock.  They lost 31-28.  Bummer?  Yes, but in some sense, no.  I know we have a lack of a football crowd here, but:

1)  Cal's Coach (Tedford), never runs up the score.

2)  Cal always loses when it matters most -- take last year for example.  In a game against Arizona State, they fell 24-20, in the game before USC.  What did they end up doing?  Sharing the Pac 10 title, and going to some bowl game that no one remembers.

The thing is, Cal gets nervous and doesn't play many big names this year anyhow -- with wins against cupcake teams like Louisiana Tech, I don't think they would have had a chance against Ohio State anyway.  Cal will always have more nobel prize winners and nobel laureates, but they just can't win in football.  Shame -- and they could have put themselves on the map as a great institution too (I say this because people in the US pay more attention to sports than academics.)
