In my last post, I discussed the various factors that influenced my decision to join the workforce upon graduation. Of course, the value of that decision depends on where I begin my career. I will explore that here.

<h3>Just Facebook</h3>

My internship with Facebook was enjoyable. Compared to my summer in Redmond, I learned a lot more things, connected a lot more with my co-workers, worked on a more meaningful project, and had a lot more fun. Naturally, my first choice for full time was Facebook. Facebook had every feature I wanted from an employer. Throughout the summer, I didn't even consider alternatives. Google was past its prime. Microsoft even more so. Two Sigma, despite rousing some interest when they contacted me in the summer, elicited only the following response from me:
<blockquote>I am in no hurry, so if it is inconvenient for you to wait until after Aug 20, I will pass on this opportunity.</blockquote>

Then the summer came to an end and I got my return offer. Of course, compensation is only a part of the entire package, and for a new grad (independent of other factors) it's great, but I was shocked.

Relative to 2009, 2010 was a good year for tech workers in the Silicon Valley and an especially great year for Facebook and its competitors. My expectations were high. My mentor told me that technology is the best place to build wealth through equity (stocks). Facebook has been telling us throughout the summer that we are exceptional talent, that it hires only the best, and that (essentially) Google hires its rejects. Surely it must compensate well for that type of talent, and it seemed like it did in the years before: Someone who started this summer would be worth over a million dollars (just from stocks) based on <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/03/why-facebook-is-such-an-important-friend-for-goldman-sachs/">Goldman Sachs' recent investment in Facebook</a> which valued it at $50 billion.

This year was not the same. Facebook realized that it became the top dog in hiring and naturally decided to take advantage of that. I will not state exact offers (but you can certainly find them on Quora if you care enough), but the 89% drop in the stock grant baffled me. I was anticipating a 2-3 fold decrease over the span of a year due to changes in Facebook's valuation, probably closer to 2 since the valuation last fall was depressed (relative to some true value) by the still-depressed stock market and the yet-unannounced cash situation (Facebook became cash flow positive in the summer quarter of that year, meaning that it did not need any future infusions of cash to sustain investments and growth). 

I felt betrayed, mislead, taken advantage of, by the company that I loved and cared so much about (If you don't believe me, look at <a href="http://docs.orijing.com/college/2008/ugba10/module4/essay4.pdf">my UGBA 10 module 4 paper</a> from my freshman year in college in which I identified Facebook as my ideal company). I felt immense regret for pursuing a seemingly-useless third simultaneous degree (business administration--a trade-off that I <a href="/node/494">explored in detail</a> in 2009), because otherwise I could have graduated a year in advance.

My recruiter did not help. When I voiced my concerns, she claimed that there was nothing she could do, because I have no competing offers, as if to imply that nothing I will get outside of Facebook will be nearly as competitive. I never thought that I had to interview again for at least a few more years, but I was determined to prove her wrong and to find the opportunities I was looking for.

<h3>Opening Doors</h3>

I had a candid discussion with my mentor afterwards to get his input. His words were reassuring. He eliminated my doubt regarding whether I can find more competitive offers; he suggested that I ask not for a third or half of last year's offer, but exactly that offer; he shared with me his stories and how he came to Facebook. I decided to take his advice. I didn't really <em>want to</em> start my career (and work for the next few years) at a company I've never worked at, but I wanted to see what else was out there.

<h3>Reconsidering Two Sigma</h3>

Two Sigma is an algorithmic trading hedge fund and I was always interested in working for one. Compensation is generous and technical work is plentiful in that field. Their focus fit very well with my resume: Business for finance information; computer science for algorithmic and systems abilities; and economics for the more theoretical aspects of markets and trading.

So I emailed back Two Sigma. Despite being (somewhat rudely) rebuffed initially, they were happy to talk to me. They scheduled a phone interview where they asked me various non-technical questions. Then they emailed me a few programming assignments that I had to complete (and email back) in two hours. I wrote the natural solutions for all of them (in Java since they emphasized that they're Java-heavy). After testing, I still had over an hour left so I decided to be fun and write a regular expression one-liner solution for one problem (definitely not the most practical, but works and demonstrates that I know some basic regular expressions), and complemented the second solution (written in Java) with a solution in C.

They were apparently impressed enough to fly me over to New York City for an on-site interview. They booked my flight, hotel and promised to pay me back for all of my expenses along the way (i.e. taxis). They were very generous with the accommodations, locating me in a nice suite in Soho Grand, equipped with various excesses like a 27" Mac, a flat screen TV and a bed wider than it is long.

The next morning at 8 (eastern), I walked to their office with barely 3 hours of sleep that night, an unfortunate product of jet lag and anxiety. After a full breakfast and some tea, I was introduced to the first interviewer.

The interviews were long--over 6 hours of back-to-back interviews with an hour for lunch with a high-frequency trader from Quebec and another employee of Two Sigma. Some interviewers asked me to write code on the board. Others watched as I coded on the laptop. My tired brain struggled through the questions on algorithms, systems, concurrency, and even probability. The problems were difficult, and I tripped up on a multiprogramming/concurrency/producer-consumer problem. But I could tell that most of my interviewers were impressed.

At the end of the day, I had a chat with the recruiter who asked about the competing offers and my deadlines. Then I was off to pick up my stuff from the hotel, eat a quick meal, and fly back. (Unfortunately, I missed my flight because of the deadlocked traffic, but I'll spare you the details)

On the way back, I reflected on the types of people I met that day, conversations I've had and the various teams in the organization. I flew into New York with basically no interest in the job--only the misplaced hope that a lucrative competing offer would encourage Facebook to reassess its offer. But I was impressed with the caliber of its employees, the enthusiasm of everyone, and the promise of competitive compensation. At this point, my main concern was location

<h3>Two Sigma, Round Two</h3>

Apparently six hours of intense interviews isn't enough to assess someone's fit. I was invited back for another round of interviews. Instead of packing it all into one trip (the cost of the first trip easily exceeded $2000), they spread it out over two rounds of on-site interviews. I wasn't so thrilled because I was taking 21 units and had a looming Facebook deadline and four midterms the following week. Nevertheless, I
