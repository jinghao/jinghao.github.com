Nearly three months after my previous (beloved) bike was stolen from my parking lot, I bought another one off some guy on Craigslist. The bike is nice and it came with two locks. The seller didn't even have a cell phone and was wearing junky clothing. Why do I have the feeling that the bike was stolen?
