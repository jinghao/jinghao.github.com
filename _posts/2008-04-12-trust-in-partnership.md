I spent an hour or two developing a <a href="http://docs.orijing.com/scripts/prisoner.php">Prisoners' Dilemma Simulator</a>, and I want everyone to give it a try after I explain what it is and how it works (but not technically--because that would reveal too much). It's a classic implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma" rel="external">prisoners' dilemma</a>, a commonly-recurring circumstance in game theory.

Here's how it works: You go to the page and choose one of the two options, and you are taken to a confirmation page that prints a link for someone (a friend, acquaintance, foe, whatever) to follow up on. (Keep in mind this requires the participation of two people) When your <em>accomplice</em> finishes his part, ask him to share the result with you.

How your response and your <em>accomplice</em>'s response turn out to be will reveal much about the level of trust in your relationship. For best results, do not communicate about this prior to seeing the result.

If you like the simulator or if you think it is cool, please share it with your friends and <a href="http://digg.com/odd_stuff/Prisoners_Dilemma_Simulator"><strong>Digg this page</strong></a> so others may play too!
