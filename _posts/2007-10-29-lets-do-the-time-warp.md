Cal Student Orientation was really cheesy. A lot of funky icebreakers and building school spirit by putting others down, mainly Stanford. I guess the Stanford rejects at Cal (that is, the majority of Cal students) are still pretty bitter about not getting in. Yes, we're the number 1 public school in the nation, but Stanford is still several spots above. Might as well stop being in denial.

Apparently most science majors are Asian and most are doing MCB. The one non-asian in my group had a Mao emblem on his backpack (wtf) and impressed the FOB asian girls with his ability to write in chinese. So much for diversity.

I remember during the summer a Junior walked by a CalSO group and yelled "Berkeley sucks!!" Then someone asked why, and she was like, "actually I love Berkeley. I just like scaring Freshman." Summer finals were coming up too at that time too. 

Anyway, two more months for me! :D
