Judge Robert Restaino, a Judge from Niagara Falls, New York, was fired ["for jailing 46 people after none of them would admit to having a cell phone that began ringing during his court session."](http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/article.html?in_article_id=77359) When the phone rang, he screamed: "Every single person is gong to jail in this courtroom unless I get that instrument now. If anybody believes I'm kidding, ask some of the folks that have been here for a while. You are all going."

When nobody came forward, "the judge ordered the group into custody and they were taken by police to the city jail, where they were searched and packed into crowded cells; fourteen people who could not post bail were shackled and bused to the Niagara County Jail, a 30-minute drive away."

And supposedly he did all this because "he was under stress in his personal life." I hope local judges are paid by the local government. I certainly don't want my parents' tax dollars to fund this kind of (mis)behavior.
