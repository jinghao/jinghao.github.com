I'm practicing Flash, the functional way. I made a light-weight chat-room application with flash that is ugly but functional.

Features planned for the future:
1. Smilies
2. Making "enter" synonymous with clicking the button
3. Redesigning the style to be less atrocious
4. Showing "users online"
5. Notifying others of user name and status changes
6. Auto-scroll for long chat transcripts
