I'm sure many of you have noticed "advancedversion", our newest contributor. He is my CS grader/reader. That's all. (I really don't have much to say about him, so figure out what you want from his profile and posts)

But I would like to formally amend my <a href="node/26">prior post</a> that we aren't Hindu. Finally someone appropriate for this site? Perhaps.
