A partnership between Duke University and Boston College resulted in the discovery of a [metallic material](http://devicedaily.com/environment/new-material-absorbs-light-completely-and-generates-electricity.html/) that "absorbs both the magnetic and electrical properties of electromagnetic waves over a certain frequency range, thus turning the light into heat." Good job, geniuses. There is such a thing called dark hair (I have to deal with this all the time) and black paint, either of which does a good job of converting all incident light into heat. I don't need a degree in Material Sciences Engineering to recognize what a joke this is, and neither should anyone else.

Here's a suggestion Jay made for these brilliant scientists: "maybe they'll invent a means for people to carry portable light, so they can see into dark places."
