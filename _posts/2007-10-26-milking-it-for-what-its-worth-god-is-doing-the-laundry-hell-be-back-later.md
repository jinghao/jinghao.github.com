I think I should make it clear, that for now, I've decided not to go down the path of religion and spirituality.  I've decided to wait for God to finish doing his laundry.

No, it's not because I don't want to be saved.

No, it's not because I disagree with what God says.

No, it's not because I don't want to go to heaven, where everything is good.

I've decided to wait until he comes back from the laundromat, basket of clothes in one hand, and a welcoming hand in the other, finally telling me that my text messages, emails and phone messages have finally got to him.  

I'm not religious because of the reputation it has given itself over the past 2,000 years.  From the crusades of the 1200s to Billy Graham of today, I think that religion is too often forced upon the intellect of the people.  Children at the age of three, who barely understand what it means to go to the bathroom, are shoved in their face that if they believe a certain doctrine from a young age, they will be saved.  And while that may be right to a certain degree, it ruins one's logical and intellectual development.  Until Christianity creates a better image of itself beyond the political terror, cultural attacks, childhood development and brainwashing, then I may consider -- There is a clear reason why my girlfriend isn't Christian -- she went to a fundamentalist elementary school that couldn't accept her ways of digging things up and realizing that there may have been evolution.  All this, while God was putting the socks into the dryer.

The other question, regarding God, to me is completely different.  Whether he exists or not merits another post, to be debated later, but even that, I am not sure.  Religion seems so vague, yet it seems to real sometimes when you wonder about why things happen to you.  Never mind that sometimes science can't even explain phenomena.  The Bible can only tell you so much.

The other reason why I am not religious is the definition of truth.  At my grandma's assisted living community the other week, I was met by a lady who watched my grandmother cry upon realization that her parents were dead (my grandmother is 97), something that comes up all too often.  While often comfortable with the notion that Christians are willing to share their side of the story and their faith story, I'm somewhat troubled when they claim that they possess and know the truth over others.  I wonder, do <i>you</i> really know what truth is?  The last time I checked, truth was subjective.

What this ultimately may come down to is the fact that a few bad apples ruin it for everyone.  It's the Billy Graham's that make Evangelicals seem like the next wave of Hitlers; the born again Christians that make Republicans seem like they are violating the makeup of the US; It's the few Democrats like Pelosi's incompetence which makes everyone wonder what the heck happened.  Why can't we live in this world as Deists?  Why can't we accept the fact that God created the world, left it alone to go do the laundry, and wanted to come back later and check on it (also known as Judgment Day)?  Did he have to leave a vague set of rules and regulations for his people to follow?  Faith can do so much, it seems.   Faith can only tell us how far God is done with his laundry.

Hopefully the laundry will be done soon.  Meanwhile, I'll sit here and wait until he comes.
