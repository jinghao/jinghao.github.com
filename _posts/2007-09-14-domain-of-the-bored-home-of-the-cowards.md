Admit it, cows are one of the most cowardly animals (above 500 kilograms) you'll ever eat in your entire lifetime. Cows just can't sit (stand?) still with even the slightest tickle. Anything frightens them into panic mode, causing the stampedes that kill more squirrels (actually I don't think they share habitats--there's probably a good reason) than Ford ever did. Honestly, this is probably why the word "coward" was derived from the word "cow" (it wasn't).

Have you wondered why all domesticated cows end up in the slaughterhouse? Well, just by <i>pure coincidence</i>, "the maximum punishment for cowardice is the death penalty", according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coward). Yup, that's right. That is why cows end up in the slaughterhouse--they are <b>cow</b>ards.

So why are we supporting the plight of the universal <b>cow</b>ards? Because we are cowards ourselves. Don't ask me why or how--we just are.
