In my edition of this novel by Herman Melville which was published in 1971, there is an "is" *masquerading* (sorry) as an "it" on page 103. It's funny that 38 years after the novel's publication, the publisher still hasn't fixed the typo. Anyway, that sentence with two consecutive "is"es greatly confused me. I'm surprised nobody else suffered the same confusion!
