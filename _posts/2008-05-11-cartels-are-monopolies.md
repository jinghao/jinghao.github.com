By definition and fact they are. So when the Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva said "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/10/business/worldbusiness/10oil.html" rel="external">we want to join OPEC and try to make oil cheaper</a>," I naturally cringed. Since when were monopolies formed (or expanded) in order to reduce prices?
