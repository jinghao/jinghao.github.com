According to our beloved President, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/us/nationalspecial3/06interrogate.html" target="_blank">"This government does not torture people,"</a> because he "put this program in place ... to better protect the American people."

Obviously, someone forgot his favorite bureaucracy (the C.I.A.), for which the Justice Department gave authorization "to barrage terror suspects with a combination of painful physical and psychological tactics, including head-slapping, simulated drowning and frigid temperatures." For once, Senator Charles E. Schumer gave an intelligent response to all the shenanigans; he notes that "when the president says the Justice Department says itâ€™s O.K., he means Alberto Gonzales said it was O.K."

I guess the lunatics running the Guantanamo Bay prison aren't considered to be a part of "this government", or the suspected terrorists aren't really people. Pretty tricky, Mr. President! For someone who can't correctly pronounce Nu-kular, you sure know how to deceive. Some may even go as far as saying that you only <i>feign</i> foolishness.
