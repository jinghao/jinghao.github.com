Okay, so playing the piano is not the same as practicing the tango. Still, piano-playing was never meant to a strictly solitary activity--to be heard by just the player because that would be boring; it was meant to be shared. I wasn't quite sure why I held that view until tonight, but now it's clear: because you can "steal" others' pieces (aka play them yourself).

In the music room, after warming up a bit with some old recital pieces, I noticed that someone in a neighboring music room was playing a piece I recognized (Mozart's Sonata in A Minor), so I started playing the openings of the piece myself, as loudly as I could. The neighbor paused for a moment, and then it briefly returned to business-as-usual. Then, while I was playing the Moonlight Sonata (last movement), I noticed that the neighbor was playing the same thing, too, so I yelled "She stole my song!".

Almost immediately, the neighbor knocked on <span title="Tricia and I were in the music room"><i>our door</i></span> intending to apologize for "stealing" "my" song. It's nice to know that some people still retain their senses of humor after high school.
