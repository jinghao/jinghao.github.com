According to the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7072404.stm), "the Westboro Baptist Church was taken to court by the father of Lance Cpl Matthew Snyder, a marine who died serving in Iraq in March 2006," for attending the soldier's funeral with signs reading "Thank God for dead soldiers" and "You're going to hell".

The same source also indicates that this is not the first time the church has caused trouble--"Members of the church - based in Topeka, Kansas - have denounced homosexuality for years, initially targeting the funerals of Aids victims." Now, they have extended their pickets to the funerals of soldiers, who they believe are being punished by God "because of America's tolerance of homosexuality."

Ironically, defense attorney Jonathan Katz argued that "the $2.9m in compensatory damages already far exceeded the defendants' net worth and would be enough to 'bankrupt them and financially destroy them'"--isn't that the point? Yet, despite the seriousness of the verdict Rev. Fred Phelps--the head of the church whose membership consists mostly of his extended family--confidently dismisses the verdict, believing that "it will take the 4th Circuit of Appeals a few minutes to reverse this silly thing."

What has America come to?
