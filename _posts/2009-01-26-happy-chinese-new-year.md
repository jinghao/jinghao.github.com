Happy <img src="/system/files/logo2.png" alt="Niu" title="Niu" /> year, everyone, from the Daily <img src="/system/files/logo2.png" alt="Cow" title="Cow" />! This is our year. Let's make it a good one! (For my non-Chinese friends, the mandarin pronunciation of cow is "Niu", which is just a slightly accented version of "New" (English, obviously). Apologies for the terrible pun)
