So Taiwan decided to assert their independence again, by passing a motion to declare themselves separated from China.  Okay, so I can take that.  Here's what bothers me, according to the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070930/ap_on_re_as/taiwan_politics">AP on Yahoo! News</a>:

<blockquote>In other moves to assert its separateness from China in recent months, Taiwanese officials have announced plans to revise school textbooks to drop references that recognize Chinese historical figures, places and artifacts as "national" and said they were considering abandoning Taiwan's long-standing policy of recognizing Mandarin Chinese as the island's only official language.</blockquote>

See, this is what I have with issue with the Taiwanese.  Nevermind separating themselves from the mainland, but what they are trying to do by dropping references that recognize Chinese historical figures, places and artifacts as "national" is the bigger issue.  Taiwan is throwing away their culture, in every sense of the mind.  And to make this worse, Taiwan itself has <i>no</i> culture to begin with anyway, unless you count the night market a true tangible piece of culture, which it really isn't.  I won't argue anymore about this, but I will say that this agenda is the prescription for cultural downfall.
