It never ceases to amaze me how horrible some people can even be when it comes to debating or discussing.  Truly, it's saddening that people can toss out lines and lines of ad hominems but never really be able to get their point across.

Case in point:  Read what <a href="http://scu.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=12746620262#comments">Jonas Aleksandras Pauliukonis</a> has to say.  It's not so much that he's a Republican (I don't care), but more of the fact that he makes blatant assumptions about people.

The text comments (Jonas is a bit more below, but you have to read the entire text to get it):

fight for freedom beyond our borders. The only amount of land we have
ever asked for in return is enough to bury those that did not return.""

You'll have to remember that Colin Powell was sold out by Bush, in his attempt to get the Iraq war going. The war over Iraq IS over the war for land, and the oil-rich resources that Iraq possesses. There is no doubt on that argument right there. I support my troops going over there, but I do not support the cause that they fight for -- it is irrelevant (Saddam was not a threat) to the fight on terror (that's in Afghanistan, remember?), and a waste of my tax dollars which I would prefer to go and fix domestic infrastructure.

it so you wouldn't have to speak German."

The Europeans have you noticed, are much smarter, and much more well versed in languages. I personally think that it brings down our nation to only have to learn English, and then learn a 2nd language when it is hardest (in high school and beyond). And hey, the Euro is stronger than the dollar now...

Tony, I totally agree with what you are saying bro. Seriously America is flawed, but so is humanity so it's only natural that a country based on the values and basics rights of humanity would reflect humanity and it's flawed nature.

In response to Albert, I must say that just because the Europeans on a general basis know more languages does not mean they are smarter than Americans as a whole. If that were true, than most European countries would have the largest GDP's and would have the most respected and known business'.

I think I'm just noticing this, but doesn't the US have the worlds largest GDP and one of it's own states (Cali BABY!) have the 5th largest in the world?

Though I do agree with you on the time when to learn languages (which our country is finally starting to implement at earlier stages), America grants the freedom to choose if you WANT to learn a new language. We don't force you to like many European schools do.

Finally, monetary value does not illustrate the intelligence of a country. While the Euro is stronger, it is because there are so many nation's economies backing that form of curency that it is worth more. Yet, I think it's quite funny that for a single form of currency, it takes so many nations to even overcome the power of the American dollar.

In reference to your Powell comment, I think what he said was very powerful.

While I do agree that much of the backing for the war was for oil, it does not mean it was the sole purpose. Frankly I think that any man disliked by his people (and his troops for that matter), and keeps them in line through a personal guard of killers and the use of botox and other neurotoxins, should not be in power.

Yet I do not support the war at this moment. And I do feel we should pull out. Because Iraq will not learn to take care of itself unless we push them to do so, and staying in Iraq is not helping to make them independant. I support the troops fully, yet keeping them in Iraq is not something I support.

On a side note about the original war we are still fighting in afghanistan, I thought it was an amazing move to not only help to liberate afghanistan from an muslim fundamentalist group (any group that treats women as inferior has a problem in my book).

Furthermore, back to Iraq (sorry I'm trying to address all your points), while I do agree Sadam was not a threat to the US (he was too cowardly to ever attempt an attack on the US), he was a threat to his people, which is a horrible thing. And if you have the power to stop some horrible person in power (which the US does, and should use responsibly), they should be stopped.

I'm sorry to say, but I think it's bullshit about how the world treats the US in terms of global power. If we don't help, we are a greedy bullshit country who hides in themselves....If we do....we are a power hungry country seeking to make itself into the ruler of the world.

It's not just languages that make Europeans smarter. It's the fact that they are more well versed in mathematics (why would you not use the metric system, is really something that I have never understood) as well as things regarding political science. America in fact, was founded on ideals relating to what European thinkers thought during the enlightenment era, and such thought has been lost in the United States.

The fact that the Euro is stronger also tells me two things:

The United States is no longer a global superpower, and that means that the global centers are beginning to move both east and west. Businesses are now thriving on profits because they outsource activity. Europe is gaining and has gained on the United States because they are becoming more unified. Is the United States losing? Depends. I think the fact that we have to import intelligence from foreign nations to do our work in the science and technology sector really speaks volumes about education within the United States, but that argument is more on the public school level.

While the sentiment is admirable, it is inherently reactionary. We must remember that we are human like everyone else, that carries with it a sense of humility. Though the statements in the original note are well founded and true they exacerbate the problem rather than solve it. The world is angry with us because we are full of ourselves and some of the responses above would be spot on without the argumentative bent to them. For instance the engineer's response was perfect but he didn't need to insult the French. Ideally we need to portray our good side that inspires some of the actions we point to rather than turning each of our fair deeds into a fact to lord over our international brother's heads. In conclusion, there is the same paltry amount of intelligence everywhere; try to prove that you're part of it.

True to the fact that America is respected by much of the world, but much of that respect has been lost since Bush began doing the warmongering things that he has done. Going it alone on Iraq, wiretapping his own people, among other things, are things that make Bush hated around the world. And it's not just Bush either. Terrorists want to attack us because we 1) have a lot of freedoms (which I do not mind) but also because 2) we meddle in everyone's business where we shouldn't, such as middle east politics, among other things. Maybe it's because I'm Chinese and China for the most part has had an isolationist policy, but going into places where we don't understand the status quo is absolutely wrong and immoral (think Woodrow Wilson and his 14 points in 1918).

I do not hate America, for it gives a whole other world of opportunities unrivaled, HOWEVER, it presents so many problems that could have been fixed if it were not for a bureaucracy that champions sluggish policy over practical matters.

I think I'm mostly going to stay out of this one, I think, because I have friends on both sides of this debate that I'd rather not alienate. I will say that patriotism taken to extremes is the foundation of global conflict, and what could be more stupid than fighting a war based on loyalty to an artificial boundary. Americans do, however, deserve credit for expressing their outrage - as well as support - for the state of things today, and it is the sign of our greatest hope. But we have to be very careful - we cannot get so tied up in congratulating ourselves to neglect our image. American hegemony is as dangerous as any other hegemony, and this administration is far from the first to promote it. We shun new ideas far too easily and quickly, even if we make a semblance of tolerating them. Every now and again, we need to remind ourselves that our ultimate loyalty ought to be to the welfare of our fellow man the world over, not a country or government.

I love the typical democratic answer to the war on terror... that it is over land and oil... for anyone to say that is simply following the ludicrous claims that uneducated and anti-bush people conjured up to raise a stir in society.... My response to the need for oil: Hm, considering that oil prices are on an eventual path to becoming ridiculously expensive, I doubt that. And even if the war WAS to be on oil, that war would be in response to the democratic idea that offshore drilling and the whole ANWR project in Alaska is going to slowball and destroy life on our planet as we know it... so, you say no to getting oil from these resources... where to then? do the democrats have some secret reserve of oil that they are hiding?

And for the whole "land" argument... No offense to those of middle eastern descent, but that land is barren. The only area that is pumping dollars into its infrastructure on a rate that you would really want to take it would be Dubai...

After I read all that was written on this subject (by the way, congratulations comment writers!) I couldn't help but wish to join in on the discussion. And as usual, I'm not going to take a side and argue for or against any of your guys' comments. I'm just simply going to share my views and what I think about America (keep in mind, I'm from Bulgaria and I came here in 1997). If you want to argue with what I'm saying... go ahead... it doesn't really matter...

Yes, America is the richest and most powerful country in the world. Do I necessarily think it should be that way? Not necessarily. But as such, it has a lot of things that we should be thankful (and proud) we have; things that we sometimes take for granted. America has one of the best infrastructures in the world. It also probably has the best medical system in the world (note I said "medical", not "health care") because the kinds of treatment you can get in the US are a lot rarer and more difficult to get in other countries. ...

... America also has (I think) a really unique and well designed system of government (with the three branches) because it can be made to evolve and change as society changes. In addition, it is the land where a lot more human rights are recognized and upheld, compared to other countries. This land of opportunity enables you to earn your money and grow/develop yourself into the person you want to be, as long as you have the skills and passion. I guess all I'm trying to say here is that the rules and structural foundation of America has been really well thought-of. But this doesn't mean America doesn't have its problems.

Even though the way the "American system" (if I may label it as that) has been set up really well, it doesn't mean that it's necessarily being USED well in all cases. I don't personally think that America should see itself as better than the rest of the world, because let's face it: America was MADE UP from "the rest of the world." ...

... American culture is the result of the combination of all other cultures in the world, some represented more and some less. But they are all here in some shape or form. That's what makes us unique and different. But unfortunately it also makes SOME people feel that just because they are Americans, they are superior to other people from the world. I don't think that should necessarily be the case.

As far as American politics go... ugh, that's a huge and complicated topic. One of my favorite quotes of all time is "before you attempt to correct someone else and impose on them what you think or believe is right, first ensure that you are absolutely correct yourself." I believe that America can learn from this quote. We should focus on making ourselves as close to perfect as we can get (though nothing can ever be 100% perfect) and only THEN try to go and win the hearts and minds of the rest of the world. I'm implying "let's not help the other nations of the world to improve." ...

And this is especially true about war: war doesn't help anybody. It only hurts more people (directly and indirectly).

So yeah... well, I don't feel like writing any more, plus I don't think I have much else to say right now. I am going to conclude by saying that America is great in a lot of ways, and I am definitely thankful that I came here, but there is still a lot of room to improve. It's not the system that's flawed, it's the way it's run that is flawed. Kinda like... having a really great computer program but not having a very good computer user, I guess.

In response to Daniel's comment...while I personally don't associate with any political party (I vote for whomever suits me best), I really don't feel that a talk on the president and the way America is (in general) needs to have an Anti-Democrat or Anti-Republican rant. In my personal opinion it lessens the arguement by showing that you can't see or embrace both sides of the arguement.

Anyways, in response to albert's many posts, i do agree with you on some points espescially:

1) Americas view of the public school system. Frankly I really agree that the US has lost focus on the education system...where a lot of things were stressed in the past (ie math and science during the 60's and 70's).

2) In all honesty, I don't like bush. I mean he's not a bad person...he's just not qualified for the presidency. Sure he has done some wonderful things, but that does not mean he is a great president or leader for that matter.

While I feel that we shouldn't meddle in everyone's business....I feel strongly in the fact that we SHOULD take a stance. I mean, it's like seeing someone kill your best friend and saying "it's their business let them deal with it". Honestly I feel that if we view something immoral, we should attempt to put a stop to it. Murder is still murder even if you call it by another name.

Secondly, while outsourcing is a major thing in american companies...it is not being used for the high level jobs, espescially jobs that require a huge amount of intelligence. It's used for low-level jobs...(hello telemarketers...you rock -_-). It's not being used for jobs that actually would cost the company money if it didn't work out. Outsourcing is used in most countries for experts, and in general, America is not outsourcing it's high-level jobs any more than any other country in the world.

He failed miserably at attempting to demonstrate that this is due to the fact that the Europeans are more well verses in foreign languages... While I agree that they are versed in languages better than Americans are, this has no effect on the face value of currency.

The demand for money as issued by the federal government, and in Europe's case, the EU reflects the value of money... It is clear that the US Dollar is depreciating in value more or less because it is in such high demand domestically and internationally...

The US dollar is backed in Hong Kong, and in many cases of poorer countries around the world, individuals seek to obtain US Dollars because they know that they will not decline in value and that they are safe... Take the current inflation in Zimbabwe as an example... they are in a state of hyper-inflation...

I mean more of domestic outsourcing. If you look at the PhD programs across the United States, the majority of the students there are foreign. We pay people to come in and do the work that we can't. The supply of labor of people who can do the high-level work is at a minimum. That's all I wanted to say.

Does the government truly work for the people? I question that on a daily basis, because if the government truly worked for the people, would our senators be taking in millions from organizations such as the NRA to back gun control? I feel like sometimes my senator(s) and elected officials (AHEM... Nancy Pelosi) aren't doing the job they were voted in to do. It's quite disappointing.

I agree on that point, but doesn't the fact that American Hegemony has angered countries such as Iran take to that point? I know Iran is crazy, and has weapons, but by the same token, America has tons and tons of nuclear weapons too. Iran is using the kid-to-parent analogy: Until the parent (US) changes their policies towards nuclear weapons and Israel, then the kid (Iran) will change theirs.

I'm no fan of dictatorship, but what we need is a consensus, really, and the only way we can achieve this is through a multi-party system.

I frankly thing the major 2-party system is out of whack and allows little to no voting for other parties or other officials (it's just a wasted vote since everyone knows the dems or repubs will win no matter what). I would actually prefer a more percentage based representation such as what is in the British Parliament due to the fact that multiple parties could help to fix the tug-of-war between the democrats and republicans (though in a sense multiple parties could just be a hidden way of still maintaining a 2 party system with parties allying to get their agenda across).

Wow, I'm really torn about whether to continue on this or if it'll just waste bandwith; I'm known to be quite long-winded about such things. :-p

Cool discussion, though! This is how change starts, with people talking. :-D

Chris: As far as parliamentary democracy goes, I don't think there's as much danger of the extreme polarization as you describe. The system is built on coalition building, sure, but the parties maintain distinct identities in spite of it because parties on the same ideological side will inevitably disagree on at least some issues. Most often, percentage representation is fairly stable in that respect. Plus we could remove a great deal of the corruption in the system. However, there is a real danger of a uni-party dominance, as in India and Mexico, in which one party gains a majority and holds it for decades, often through rigged elections. I don't think we'd have that problem here, but it is a real consideration.

On the Euro issue, it's not the strongest currency yet, but many Middle Eastern countries are considering switching to the Euro as their backing currency, partly because it is such a strong currency but probably also because we've pissed them off so badly. :-p

Damn, got hooked in anyway...

I'm kind of for a parliamentary system, so that there is somewhat of a system of checks. I mean, there are people who would have loved to have one in 2000, when Gore won by a great margin of votes over Bush but still lost (sheesh, I guess you don't deserve the presidency when you lose your own friggin' home state). But I don't know, it's really the electoral college system that sucks.

Albert, with the volume of responses you have made to this note, I have concluded that a) you have no life, b) you're out to just cause trouble, c) you have no pride whatsoever in the country that is educating you (i.e. why not study in your home country?), d) you don't understand facts from fiction, or e) all of the above. I think you could use a good dose of humility and just admit that you might NOT have all the answers or access to information circulating at our highest level of government. So SHUT UP!

Jonas,

From the level of your response, I'm guessing that you either don't enjoy discussion around the level of this country, think that this country is perfect (which it is far from), don't have the facts that you ought to have to make judgments, and really don't know who I am.

If you like to quell my opinions and create a homogeneous nation where everyone follows everyone else, then damn straight I'll move somewhere else, because a lack of diversity creates a lack of discussion which leads to a slippery slope down to a totalitarian nation.

And finally, I really enjoy the fact that you ad hominem me when you haven't even read anything yourself -- why not step back, look at the facts, and question what is around you. You have a brain, you might as well use that three pound muscle for something, you know.

Also -- don't assume, which you do plenty there. You don't know me, and I don't know you, and I assume you could care less about getting to know me because I probably carry a different political affiliation than you do. Read the 15 or so posts that I wrote up there: I NEVER mention that ANY of them were answers to ANY of the problems up there that I explained. If I really had all the answers, I don't think I'd be going to college, or be here at Santa Clara either. What's wrong with discussion anyway?

And before I leave this post to go do something else with my life (apparently, I do have one...), I also want to note that in this thread I also indicate that I am proud of this country because of the opportunities that it provides -- I would never survive in China. However, there is no problem with dissenting to what the country does: I'm sure at some point, you disagree with policies set forth by our current administration as well (unless you are a hardcore Bush-Republican backer). So before you go out of your way to assume I have no pride, how about reading a little bit more of this thread before just counting how many times my name appears under comments. I have no interest in quarreling with you -- I just want to know that your facts are mis-stated, and I want to make myself clearer.

Good day.

Far from it, Albert. It's clear you have some sort of paranoia regarding government (which might be bred from an experience with the Chinese government). All that you have spouted has come directly from liberal blogs and what is spewed by the media as all of these "arguments" (read bitching and moaning) have been made time and again by other people. Maybe you should practice what you preach and use that "three pound muscle." As for claiming to not provide any answers for government, you said earlier that "...it presents so many problems that could have been fixed if it were not for a bureaucracy that champions sluggish policy over practical matters." Sounds like a solution to me: cut bureaucracy! Nice...

Oh, so being liberal is bad now? And apparently, being conservative is nice? Hm! I never thought!

Just so you can know me a little more, I was born in the US, and I have lived all of my life here.

Bureaucracy is good at times, but in our government, it has prevented many things from happening -- health care and gun control for one, have been killed many times.

And also, I stay away from the political blogs -- I would rather not read any of them.

Enjoyed the latest Ann Coulter article?

On paranoia towards government:

Our government is heavily structured for the inefficiency. Health Care, MediCare and other important social programs have more or less been stalled in Congress since the Johnson Administration in the 1960s. Do I have any answers? No. Do I think the Chinese Socialist Agenda is any better? No. Do I think a government that goes through things blindly is more superior? No. One that understands the practical nature of a plan through a thorough analysis of numbers instead of seeing how much money a lobbyist organization is fine.

This is the last post I will make on this note as it is clear that your arrogance supersedes your knowledge. You whine about the inefficiency of government but at the same time seem convinced that government is the solution to all of your problems. We don't need any state-controlled welfare system and we don't need gun control. If you really want to "return to the roots" of American thought, consider having individual freedom trump government regulation. I'm sure your idea of a welfare system is full blown communism; making people independent on government, not the other way around. And gun control is a catch 22: bad guys will always find the means of attaining guns, so the only people you harm are the innocent families that seek protection. If a robber or would-be murderer breaks into your house, maybe in the Qian household, you all sit around the phone waiting 10 minutes or so for the police to arrive or maybe even try to battle the assailant with a baseball bat, but not mine.

Way to ruin a nice discussion, even, Jonas.

This is the last post I'll make here as well, but let's make this clear:

1) You assume. You throw ad hominems out there and fail to really address anything. Arrogance huh? Misstated facts? Liberal viewpoints? Humor me more, why won't you. This is a discussion and debate. If you really wanted to ad hominem me, I'm sure Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh would love to have you on their talk shows. It fits right in.

2) I never indicate anywhere in my points that government regulation is detrimental to society; in fact somewhere in there I state that it is good, but it has caused a loss in efficiency and a loss for the reasons of common sense -- I cite Health Care and MediCare in one instance, and I can cite Gun Control again here.

3) On your attack in your very last post, you attack the fact that I would wait around for the police? Ha, humor me won't you -- I plan to attack back, and then go after the NRA regarding...

...the fact that they have caused millions more to die because they think that lobbying Congress is conducive to national thought. And all because YOU think from a common sense point of view that gun control ought to be the slowest piece of legislation ever (consider the fact that Congress never even bothered to address gun control after VT, not even now).

So I conclude, among my other points that a) you are attacking me b) you provide no legitimate arguments to stand on your own. Really, if you want to have a healthy discussion, then talk. But really now, let's not be little children here and ruin something that was perfectly fine.
