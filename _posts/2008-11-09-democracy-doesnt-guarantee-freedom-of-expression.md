Or at least <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/world/asia/09india.html">weak ones that govern over extremely diverse regions</a>. Hindu nationalists in India offered 11 million dollars for the head of a Muslim artist who portrays Hindu gods nude, and the government is powerless to protect this artist, who promptly fled to the UAE.

It's not just China where freedom of expression is difficult to have--it's every country with tons of diverse people. America is the only exception, and it is an exception because of the unique nature of its origin: immigrants come to America with the intention of being "American," whatever that may mean, while India governs over a large subcontinent of Muslims and Hindus--the two corresponding religions are some of the world's most mutually volatile.

So Mr. America, democracy doesn't always work, especially over large regions, so stop pushing it.
