In the spirit of carrying on with the exploration of our beloved cow, I asked the question that logically follows "what do cows drink?"--what do cows <i>eat</i>? Natural answer is...beef, right? Because...mad cows are cannibals. Ok so this isn't such a neat parallel as "what do cows drink" and milk. But the question is <i>are</i> cows really vegetarian?  The cow-crusading <a href="http://www.notmilk.com/forum/859.html">notmilk.com</a> says no:

<blockquote>Forty-eight percent of dairy cows are fed roasted soybeans! Yummm. Thirty-nine percent receive dried blood from their own brutally murdered children, mothers, sisters, and aunts. Makes me sick to my stomach.</blockquote>

Oh such heart-wrenching pathos. I guess people really are desperate for having both their <a href="http://dailycow.org/node/20">pasta and beef!</a> Mmm Spaghetti and Meatballs. Actually I don't know what those meatballs are made of. Probably more dried blood. Anyway, putting the thought of eating granny for dinner aside, I suppose those farmers are doing their part for the environment. After all, recycling is part of going green, right? :P  Even if the cows aren't getting very much of those greens. 

But don't give up your lunch just yet! According to the general consensus at <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070626074808AAb1o6c">Yahoo Answers</a> the cows destined to be your steak are indeed fed corn to achieve more "marbling". Of course, the more marbling there is, the more expensive the steak, so maybe you should stick with that Kobe beef!
