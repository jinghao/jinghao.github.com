In many states, electronics companies are [required to pay for recycling functional devices](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/30/science/earth/30ewaste.html). But in many developing countries around the world, people cannot afford televisions at normal market price but would love to have some way of staying connected. Why don't we ship the televisions to those people, and they can pay for just the cost of shipping? Why waste functional hardware when we can make 99.1 million new television owners happier and more connected?
