As the price of oil creeps up to within a dollar of the 100 dollar milestone, a worldwide energy glut appears to be an unavoidable future. Yet, in a way, energy was the fastest-growing industry this year—while the broad market slumped amid a financial crunch, the world's largest solar companies grew at triple-digit percentages.

While Washington debates the environmental impacts of nuclear power, individual companies looking to capitalize on the global movement toward clean energy are emerging everywhere—in China, Germany, the Silicon Valley. Previously obscure names such as JA Solar, Trina Solar, First Solar, SunPower and Suntech Power have become familiar words on the daily top-10 movers.

The fast-paced growth in the Photo-Voltaic (PV) industry is a clear manifestation of the macroeconomic trend away from traditional sources of energy and is sure to affect how energy is collected, distributed and used around the world. In fact, the surge in demand for silicates is affecting other industries by driving up the cost of manufacturing not only PV-modules but also microchips. The best-performing companies are those that best maneuver the silicon-shortage. First Solar, which does not use silicon, can produce modules at a record-low cost of $1.19 per Watt; in contrast, other silicon-dependent companies are seeing margins crushed by the surge in cost.

With the collective revenue more than doubling each year and the cost of production falling with each innovation, the day of grid-power parity is not far away. To make that day come sooner, Berkeley's City Council voted on November 6th to finance the solar panels of homeowners who then have 20 years to pay back the city. Now it's time for other policy-makers to follow suit.
