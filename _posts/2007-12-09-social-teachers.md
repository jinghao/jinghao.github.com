Jay: Is there something about Kenneth Ribet I should know?
Me: He's my math professor next semester. Why?
Jay: We've been having a poke war for the past 3 hours
Jay: Poking every min or so

... (at 4AM PDT, Monday)

Jay: it says kenneth is still online o_o
Jay: i think he's using an auto-poke application or something.....
Jay: i could prolly get him banned o_o if i created fake accounts that poked him enough times

Jay is a second-year at Georgia Tech (which coincidentally is not U.C. Berkeley (which happens to be the institution I attend)).
