Google's valuation is greater than that of Proctor & Gamble, Bank of America, Citigroup, Intel, or Cisco--essentially all but four US companies. Is it a bubble for a company that does not sell anything tangible to be worth more than each of the world's most reputed finance and hardware companies? I think it's somewhat getting out of hand.
