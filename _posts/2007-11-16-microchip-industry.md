Intel Corp. is projected to earn 8.87 billion dollars in after-tax income next year. AMD's market capitalization is 3.0 billion dollars. If Intel acquires AMD, it will have free reign over the world's microprocessor industry and AMD's ATI (graphics) division.

Unfortunately for Intel, that would never be approved by federal anti-trust watchdogs. Meanwhile, we get better and cheaper chips every season.
