For those of you on Facebook, please join my recently-created (global) [group](http://berkeley.facebook.com/group.php?gid=6571294071) advocating for increased adoption of open-source (GNU)Linux thought universal distribution by all PC vendors. Here's my pitch:

Dell did it. HP, Lenovo, Sony, Acer (etc) can all do the same. All PC vendors should offer Ubuntu (or Fedora, if you prefer) as a viable alternative (pre-configured hardware support) to Windows and accompany those offerings with sizable discounts (50 dollars) to their Windows counterparts.

Linux has proven itself to be a strong alternative to Windows as a primary desktop (or laptop) platform. It can do everything the average computer user needs (and more for experts), all for free. Instead of having to purchase another Microsoft Office suite for 400 dollars (in addition to your PC), your computer will be packaged with OpenOffice, Firefox, and almost everything else you'll want--maybe even WINE (WIN Emulator).

The main beef people have with Linux is its purported lack of hardware support (drivers) and software support (games requiring DirectX). But the former is a misconception and the latter is not a problem for the current market Linux-on-desktop is intended for:
<ol>
<li>Ubuntu comes preconfigured to handle almost all devices (certainly more than Windows) although many device-drivers must be reverse-engineered (because companies like Broadom do not release their drivers for non-Windows platforms); the PC vendors will make sure your Linux machine is with Linux-ready hardware, putting pressure on proprietary hardware-vendors such as Broadcom to release drivers for Linux.</li>

<li>WINE lets you run almost all Windows applications, and its list of compatible software is constantly being enlarged. However, if you're such a hard-core gamer that your game won't run on Linux, you're an outlier. You can stick to Windows, but for the rest of us, Linux does everything we need it to. (Don't forget that the more Linux users there are, the more pressure developers feel to program games that are compatible for Linux) (I'm also tempted to mention VirtualBox or VMPlayer with a Windows virtual machine, but that goes against the spirit of open-source--I actually run one, though, but don't kill me)</li>
</ol>
The time of open-source computing has arrived. So who's with me?
