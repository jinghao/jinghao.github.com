President Bush's last round of golf was October 13th, 2003, when he heard about a truck bombing in Iraq.  In sacrifice and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2008/05/14/BL2008051401929_pf.html">solidarity</a> with the families of those who lost someone in Iraq, he decided to give up golf.  

Obviously, the mark of a man who is delusional and out of touch with the United States.
