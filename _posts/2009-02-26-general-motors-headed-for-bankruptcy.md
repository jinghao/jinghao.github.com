General Motors <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSN2653343220090226">lost more money</a> than its total revenue for the year--that is, its costs were more than twice its revenue. That's completely unsustainable. Even if the government pays it 30b per year, it will still be losing money. If you don't understand, take this example:

Suppose I have a store that sells widgets that <strong>cost me 61 cents to buy</strong>, and I sold a million of them for <strong>30 cents</strong> apiece last year. That makes my revenue 300,000 dollars, but my cost 610,000 dollars, making my loss (negative profit) 310,000 dollars, which is slightly greater than my revenue. Yes, that means my net profit margin is negative 103%. (That's bad, by the way)

GM fails. It needs a complete restructuring. It needs better management. And most importantly, it needs free workers--not brutal Unionized workers
