I really wonder, what does Bush care about?

- On the Iraq War, Bush claims that Congress and the United States ought to be funding the troops and let him run the war.  Does he know yet, at all, that many troops find that the conflict in Iraq is as much pointless as his presidency has been?

- On health care, Bush rejects a bill that would give the lowest income children health care benefits, and then turns around and signs a bill that sends yet more money to Iraq.

- While America's streets are riddled with crime (think LA, Richmond area near Oakland, etc...), Bush is devising plans to go ahead and attack Iran.

- While terrorist planes hit America in 2001, Bush sat in a classroom, and continued to read to kids, despite the fact that he knew there were 2 planes in the WTC, and potentially more disasters to come.

- In 2005, when Hurricane Katrina hit, Bush waited not one, two, but three days to go to Louisiana to survey the damage.  And survey he did -- he did a flyover, and called it a day.

- He criticizes Cuba, and tells them that if another Castro enters office, the US will not treat them nicely.  Really?  Do you think Cuba cares?

It's these anecdotes and more that make me wonder whether Bush is really a leader.   He certainly cares more about the military gains of the US, much more than social infrastructure -- roads and schools are no better than when he came in, but military spending is up. I don't care if he ran the state of Texas, a baseball team, or a nation.  He does not inspire in the people, he does not lead the way, and he certainly does not set a standard that countries around the world respect and try to emulate.  His religious views may land him some credibility in the religious community, but beyond the bibles and the pews of America, where the real political battles are fought, he has absolutely no clue what he is doing.  That, or he is doing it for the sake of political meandering (for example, skipping Louisiana because of their Democratic base).  It also makes me wonder:

What has democracy done for us in the last 20 years anyway?  40 years?

It also makes me wonder how Bush will act when he visits San Diego tomorrow.
