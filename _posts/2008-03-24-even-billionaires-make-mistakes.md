Carl Icahn lost billions of dollars on his oversized investment in Sears Holdings over the past year and is now <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/24/technology/24rticahn-web.html" rel="external">suing Motorola</a> for its disappointing performance. On another continent, British billionaire Joe Lewis <a href="http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2008/03/who_is_bear_stearns_investor_j.html" rel="external">bought into the now hopeless Bear Stearns at over 100 dollars a share</a>, spending over a billion dollars for a fifteenth of the company before JPMorgan agreed to purchase it for two dollars a share, costing Lewis billions.

How can they make such devastatingly erroneous bets? After all, isn't it their investment prowess that brought them the riches they have? The answer is simple economics and the efficient market theory, which states that the price of highly liquid assets reflect with almost complete accuracy the value of that asset as determined by all the information and data available to the general public. (If you know any more than anyone else does, you're a terrible insider and should be fined and jailed) Comparatively, shares of Sears and Bear Stearns were highly liquid assets. For Icahn, the problem was his short-sighted approach to business--boosting short term profitability at the expense of long term brand appeal; for Lewis, it was just too much hope and a form of self-confidence that made him unwilling to let go of the declining assets.

As you can see, even the world's most experienced investors make tragic mistakes. Although regular investors should avoid mistakes and losses whenever possible, making a mistake here and there is nothing unusual.
