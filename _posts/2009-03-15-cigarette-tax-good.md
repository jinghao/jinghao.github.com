In response to the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29688402/">recent tax increase</a> on tobacco manufacturers and the pending increase on tobacco sales, chain smokers are expressing their discontent with the authorities' decision. Although I favor a more <a href="http://dailycow.org/node/310">gradual approach to reducing the number of smokers</a>, I definitely support this decision.

One smoker, the Assistant Manager of Smoker Friendly Brandon Pitrolo, explained that he has been "smoking Marlboros since \[he\] was 18 and \[he\] just can't afford to do it anymore". Great. That's the point. Another smoker complains that he's "going to have to quit smoking soon", while yet another claims that he's "just going to cut back elsewhere". Although smokers may not like it, it seems like taxing these public grievances does work.

Let's do it some more.
