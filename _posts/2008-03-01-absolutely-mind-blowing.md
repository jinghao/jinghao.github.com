Did you know that "<a href="http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/29/resale-value-autos-cars-forbeslife_cx_jm_0229resale.html" rel="external">resale values are influenced by supply and demand in the new- and used-car market</a>"? It's so profound. Wow. I think I'd be more impressed if I read this before Alfred Marshall's <em>Principle of Economics</em> was published, but that was before a market for used cars developed.
