A [study](http://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/dn14964-gene-mutation-predicts-future-weight-gain.html?feedId=online-news_rss20) concludes that thin people get more pleasure out of eating than fat people, and that's why they eat less.

Huh? Would you eat more if the food in front of you looks deliciously irresistible or if the food in front of you looks just edible? (Or put another way, if each gram of food gives you more pleasure or if it gives you less?)
