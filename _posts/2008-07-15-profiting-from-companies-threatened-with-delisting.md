Publicly traded companies currently listed on an exchange (NASDAQ for example) but fail to meet the minimum requirements are given 90 calendar days to make amends or face delisting. If the company is able to turn itself around, it will remain on the exchange and the stock will appreciate; otherwise it gets delisted.

Either way, the price of the stocks will not stay the same. Therefore to take advantage of the price movement (either up or down), the investor auspicious enough to discover such a stock should buy calls at prices above the market price, and sell puts at prices below the market.

What do you think? As long as the stock moves enough, you're going to make money. Be careful, though. These companies are usually thinly-traded and hence their stocks will not be as liquid.
