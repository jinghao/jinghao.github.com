For the holiday season, [Apple will limit the iPhone to two per customer and will only accept plastic for the it](http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/hughes/20612)--a move clearly intended to counter the recent surge in "unlocking"--only a month after sharply dropping the prices in a bid to increase its adoption rate. If Apple is worrying about a supply issue, maybe they shouldn't have dropped the prices so much and so early.

On another note, the American currency is legal tender for all debts, public and private. I wonder how that's going to play out. Free iPhone, anyone?
