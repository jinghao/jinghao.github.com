In an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/opinion/06sun2.html" rel="external">editorial</a> published by the New York Times, the author, after sounding alarm at the economy's flagging growth, urges Congress to pass (and Bush to sign) a "a foreclosure prevention bill." That's the worst idea I have ever heard for giving this economy the kick it needs to get back on its tracks.
