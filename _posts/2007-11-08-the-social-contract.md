Dear Neighbor:

As you may have learned in primary school, this nation was founded on the principles of the Enlightenment Age, namely on the collective wisdom of Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and John Locke. One of the central tenets of the Age of Reason is the concept that everyone who chooses civilization over savagery enters into an implicit "Social Contract" with the society he is in. The function of the Social Contract is to allow us the maximal benefit and protection from our neighbors and our naturally "savage" ways while preserving all non-disruptive freedoms from savagery.

That means under the principles described by the Social Contract, one is free to do anything until the point at which their action affects another in a less-than-pleasing way. Former Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes got it right in his famous statement that "your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins." Therefore, your right to smoke yourself into extinction ends at the point at which you hurt others--including myself. But don't get me wrong: I am fully in support of your absolute right to cause as much damage to your lungs, brain, and other vital tissues as you wish, but you have no right to drag unwilling neighbors to the same fate.

Because of your regular smoking, my head hurts, my stomach aches, my throat itches, and my nose stings. Please, for your safety and for the general health of your miserable neighbors, reconsider your decision to continually harm yourself and others and find it within yourself to control your impulse to smoke. Otherwise, get the fuck out of my vicinity or I'll call the police.

Much love,
Your Disgruntled Neighbor
