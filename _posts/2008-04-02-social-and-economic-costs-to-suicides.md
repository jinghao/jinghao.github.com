Before I begin, I assert that this brief post is meant to be completely satirical. Please do not take offense at anything I say here.

Everyone knows the mental costs of suicides--the faces of the devastated friends and relatives are enough of an indication. But what about the social costs? Many often don't connect the fact that those who attempt suicide are unsatisfied with the circumstances of their life, and that in a highly competitive school such as U.C. Berkeley, that discouragement is likely to be from the rigor of school. So when a poorly-performing student exits, the class curve goes up, making it more difficult for you to earn the grade you believe you deserve. Perhaps the increased difficulty may induce others to follow the same path, triggering a vicious cycle. But those are trivial compared to the other costs.

Who pays for the officers who prevent these things? The health workers who treat these people? And the custodians who clean the mess off the cement? The taxpayers do, for no productive purpose either.

Even suicidal thoughts themselves incur costs; the time, energy and concentration used to contemplate (obviously not too rationally) the balance of life and death cannot be used for more productive enterprises--say, studying for next week's CS or Stat midterm. So as you can see, there are not-so-obvious costs to suicides and suicidal thoughts that end up hurting everybody.

So please, please, please do not kill yourself. Don't kill me either for writing this.
