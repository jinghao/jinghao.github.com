From Dear Abby:
<blockquote>DEAR ABBY: I am 28 years old, married for four years and have an 8-month-old son. For years I knew I wanted children and that I wanted to be a stay-at-home mother for as long as possible. I am taking a year or two off from work as a teacher to stay home with my son.

My problem is, I find playing with my son tedious, boring and frustrating. I don't mind caring for his needs, such as cleaning and feeding, but the actual playtime -- the part that is supposed to be fun, stimulating and so important to his emotional, physical and social growth -- bores me out of my mind.

I spend each day waiting for my son to nap so I can read, go online or watch TV, and I count the hours until my husband gets home so I can hand him the baby. I am seriously concerned that something is wrong with me as a mother, especially because I have suffered from depression in the past. Is this a dirty little secret that many mothers keep? -- NEW MOM IN LAS VEGAS</blockquote>
Bored? Maybe because you're from Las Vegas--seen it all, done it all--what more is there to do?

But Abby doesn't say that--she suggests that what "New Mom" is describing is a problem that is treatable. Sure, move out of Las Vegas and try somewhere boring like Nashville.
