A California software company developed an iPhone application that amplifies and filters sound taken in from a microphone. [ABC News](http://www.abcnews.go.com/Technology/AheadoftheCurve/story?id=8111001&page=1) thinks it'll be useful to the student stuck at the back of the lecture room. Somehow, I can imagine the teacher going up to a student listening intently to his iPhone in class and chastising his inattention, but I can't imagine it actually helping the student learn the material. If I had an iPhone, my first thought would not be to listen to lecture more closely...
