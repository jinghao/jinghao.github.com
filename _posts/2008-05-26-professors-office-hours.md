Does it help, really? For both of the classes whose professors' office hours I have attended--BA 10 and Physics 7B--I did extremely well (on a relative basis, of course). But do I visit the professors because I like their classes (and hence do better in their classes) or do the visits actually have some influence in how well I do?

Do you guys go to professors' office hours? Do they help? Do you go because you need help, because you have extracurricular questions (say, resume stuff), because you just like hanging out with the professor, or because ... of what?
