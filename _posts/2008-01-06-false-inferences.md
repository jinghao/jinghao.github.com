Does the fact that [Chuck Norris supports Mike Huckabee](http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=58255) make the latter a good presidential candidate? I swear, that's the only reason why the hick (For Chuck lovers, I'm referring to the latter...) received more than a small handful of votes. Screw you, Chuck Norris. Go start your own Chucktatorship and leave us alone.
