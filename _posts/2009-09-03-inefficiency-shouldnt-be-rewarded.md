While hundreds of millions of people starve in the world, "[USDA has bought about $151 billion of pork so far this fiscal year"](http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE5825FZ20090903). What are they going to do with it? Throw it away. Yes, $151b/6b=$21.2 of pork for every human in the world.
