A week ago, JPMorgan (JPM) agreed to purchase Bear Stearns (BSC), whose stock hit 170 dollars a share last year, for two dollars each, with the help of the Federal Reserve. Given the difficulty that BSC put itself in, it promptly agreed to the deal. Yet, the stock fell to only the 3-5 dollar range, hitting as high as 9 after the deal was announced and finalized. Market forces would have pushed the BSC stocks to precisely two dollars a share minus a premium for the risk involved, yet it floated above six dollars. Does this make you suspicious?

Just a few minutes ago, I was notified that "JPMorgan Chase was in talks on Sunday night for a deal that would quintuple its offer for Bear Stearns, in an effort to pacify angry Bear shareholders." It sounds like people in-the-know bought into the fallen shares based on that knowledge. This is highly suspicious--almost as suspicious as the sudden jump in options activity in Dow Jones & Co immediately before Murdoch's News Corp made its offer at over 60% above the market price.

Investors in denial argued that BSC's assets were worth more than two dollars per share, and that thus justified a higher takeover price. But in the face of the credit crunch, that does not make sense. BSC's balance sheet lists 395 billion dollars in assets--but really, given the conditions now, it is not inconceivable for that number to be 10% lower (It could be over 50% lower). 90% of that minus 384 billion dollars (BSC's liabilities) leaves a total owners' equity of -29 billion dollars. So in essence, JPM is paying 240 million dollars to acquire 29 billion dollars in net liabilities; that is why it needs the assistance of the Federal Reserve (and its money, of course). As you can see, given the market uncertainties, JPM is not getting an outrageous bargain and has no profit incentive to enlarge its offer.

So this leaves me with these questions: We all know that insider trading is bad for the average investor and the stock market in general, but how do we anticipate and prevent market failures like these? How can the SEC know whether investor X traded based on knowledge or reckless hope, for example?

Disclosure: I own no shares in BSC, short or long.

UPDATE: It looks like the Federal Reserve reluctantly approved the raised offer, causing BSC to shoot up more than 100% (over the $10 price point). Obviously there is some foul play.
