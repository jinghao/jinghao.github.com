The fanatics who like to believe that Taiwan isn't a part of China are like the freaks who think U.C. Berkeley should be separate from the rest of the U.C. system. They both attempt to justify their claim to independence from their parent bodies with their beliefs that their province or institution is somehow "better" than the rest. This seems to be what Time magazine recently advertised:

> End political apartheid! A vital life should not be limited, a democratic nation not be isolated.

> As one of the most democratic nations in Asia, Taiwan... should not be excluded from the UN. Denying Taiwan membership in the UN is political apartheid and violates the fundamental rights of its 23 million people. It is a clear breach of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

> UN Membership for Taiwan

So, needing an excuse to free up a little bit over twelve bucks, I cancelled my subscription to Time, and when prompted for why, I gave them a brief but somewhat caustic response. If you care to read:

> It is quite a shame that a magazine that claims to present issues with as much detail and attention to facts and truth as reasonably possible chose to endorse a piece of propaganda sponsored by the renegade government commonly referred to as "Taiwan". Taiwan is not a "democratic nation", and it deserves no more representation in the international body (UN) than does Japan's Hokkaido or America's California. Condoning the publication of such blatant lies and propaganda is not what I expected to get from my paid subscription.

> Yes, there are people who actually read advertisements. You just lost one of them.

Funny--are our rights as Californians (in the UN) being violated? I don't think so. And as much as we'd like to believe that U.C. Berkeley would be seventy times better were it not for the bureaucratic parent (and its not-as-successful brothers and sisters), we still belong to it. U.C. Berkeley was created as the first U.C. campus, and forever will it remain a part of the U.C. system. So shut up, Taiwan, and stop spreading lies. But thanks for giving me the excuse to reallocate those twelve bucks to (perhaps) some better uses.
