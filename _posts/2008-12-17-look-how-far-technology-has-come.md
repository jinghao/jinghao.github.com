According to a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10123138-52.html">survey commissioned by Intel</a>, more women were willing to give up sex than the Internet. Perhaps the commissioner has something to do with this. Anyway, this trend appears to be confirmed by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/lexicon/index.php?q=sex,internet">Facebook Lexicon</a>. Yes, the Internet does indeed win (except for that somewhat anomalous spike in May).
