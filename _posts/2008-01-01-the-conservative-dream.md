While consumer consumption somehow manages to barely keep the American economy above the point of recession, South Korea's electorate, upset that its economy will "expand by [ONLY] slightly less than the previously projected 5 percent in 2008 due to increased risks from the slowing global economy and firmer oil prices," decisively ejected the current ruling party in favor of the conservative opposition candidate Lee Myung-bak--a former Hyundai Group executive--"for a <strong>single five-year term</strong> from late February." Why? Because he "<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSSEO19687120080101?feedType=nl&feedName=usbusinessearly" rel="external">promised to raise economic growth to 7 percent per year on average during the <strong>next 10 years</strong></a>", as if he can control the state of the economy five years after his departure, "and lift per capita income to $40,000 from the current $20,000." That promise is totally realistic in a five-year term for a semi-mature economy, right?
