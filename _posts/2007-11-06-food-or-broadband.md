Although "broadband penetration [in Africa] is below 1%", a conference of "technology leaders" is set to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7063682.stm" target="_blank">announce</a> that "more than a third of Africa's citizens should have access to broadband internet by 2012." In order to make that happen, "the attendees were all invited to make financial commitments to improving technology and telecoms in the continent." Amazingly, "more than $3bn has been pledged so far"; Dr Hamadoun Toure, head of the International Telecommunication Union explains that "if you have just 1% of broadband access today you have 99% of opportunity."

He believes that the fact that "Africa has had the highest growth in mobile use globally--twice the global average over the past three years"--highlights the various opportunities to profit off of Africa. In a move to comfort potential investors, he added that "Africa has to create the opportunities; Africa doesn't need charity--there's nothing wrong with making profits in Africa."

Should they worry about having broadband access before they have adequate food, health care/medicine, and other life necessities, or are they completely independent goals? Is it realistic for Africa to achieve a 33-fold increase in broadband penetration in half a decade?
