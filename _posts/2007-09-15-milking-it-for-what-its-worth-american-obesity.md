To Echo Jinghao's post below, I would have to agree that America is headed on the wrong direction.  Of course, any person with any right mind knows that, unless they have had their head in the ground for the past seven to eight years.  So who do we blame?  I would want to blame the cows, but that is certainly not pragmatic enough because we can control what we eat.  I would blame the capitalist nation that we have here, but then again, that is also dictated by consumer activity and supply and demand.  I would want to blame the Republican party because they have many connections to the cattle industry, but I promised that I wouldn't get too political for our bovine friends.  

I blame the cows for reproducing so much and becoming hamburgers for our patties.

No, I'm just kidding.  I need to be more serious.  I'm having too much fun.  I think obesity is really caused by the failure of people to control their appetites.  And we blame corporate America.
