Apple stocks are down over 10% in after-market due to modest forecasts and worries about <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUKBNG4950320080722" rel="external">Steve Jobs' health</a>. If Steve Jobs dies, Apple stock goes down 60% to 60 dollars per share in one day, and an additional 50% to 30 dollars per share the next day.
