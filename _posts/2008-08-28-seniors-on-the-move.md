Professor Robinson, in his lecture about marketing, mentioned one very specialized moving company, which calls itself "Seniors on-the-Move" and (as you may have guessed) specializes in helping seniors move. They even hang their pictures up for them!

So let's go one step further: Seniors on-the-Internet. Seniors call a 1-800 number, type in their "pin", and tell the operator what website to go to. Then the operator reads the content of the page to the callers.

The callers can even get their emails read to them! Imagine that! Calling a 1-800 number to hear your emails read to you!

I'm just kidding, but this thought made me laugh.
