It was recently World AIDS week, and around campus, there were signs alluding to the fact that "AIDS doesn't discriminate".  

Does it really?

I disagree with this notion for one main reason:  Your sexual ethics and sexual activities are purely your choice.  While in one instance, you may inherit AIDS, in another instance, you do have control of where you stick your sexual organs.  In this second instance, AIDS does not discriminate.  It is merely gained by those who exhibit a lack of sexual control amongst themselves.  Alluding to previous posts, I need make no conclusions as to which individuals exhibit a lack of control, but only state that to eliminate this discrimination, you educate.  And only then, can you really say much.
