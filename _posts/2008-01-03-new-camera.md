I'm looking into one.  What do you guys prefer?

I'm looking to spend somewhere between 80 and 140 dollars, nothing more.  Latest is definitely not in the offing, but something that can take a little video and give me decent longevity is good.  Decent battery life is also a necessary component too - although I'm not sure, are batteries or chargers more superior?

(I currently own a Minolta DiMage XT)
