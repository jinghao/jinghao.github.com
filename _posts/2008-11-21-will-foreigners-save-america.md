Not if Congress can help it. At current valuations China would love to buy AMD, Sandisk, Nvidia and Citigroup for 28 billion dollars total, if not for the companies, then for their technologies (AMD, Sandisk and Nvidia) and their widely-recognized brand names. The 28 billion dollar price tag, a one-time fee annualized to perhaps 1.6 billion dollars/year at 6% interest rate, represents 5% of a percent of China's GDP now.

China has been trying hard to get into the international brand-based businesses, like processors, memory, and banking. Each company made a loss in the previous quarter and whoever buys them will have to deal with the short term consequences. But nevertheless AMD will allow the buyer to get a foothold in the processor market, and with Nvidia a near-monopoly in the graphics market; Sandisk will allow the buyer to become a major producer of solid state memory chips now and SSDs in the future; and Citigroup will allow the buyer to easily enter the US market.

So why wouldn't it happen? Protectionism in the US Congress prevents foreign acquisition of domestic assets. When a country with such a high savings rate (China) tries to put its money in the US, it is rejected. So instead of that, it's forced to purchase low-yield treasury bills whose interest is markedly less than the foreign exchange losses incurred. Last time China tried to buy something American (Unocal), it offered 20% more than Chevron, yet still was rejected by protectionists in America.

But now America's desperate. It needs money. It needs assets to be productively allocated elsewhere. It needs a buyer with tons of money to bail out lagging companies. It needs China.
