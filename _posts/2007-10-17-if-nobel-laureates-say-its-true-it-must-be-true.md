Or so you would think. James Watson, chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, "was due to speak Friday at a sold-out event" at London's Science Museum, but is <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hbWwe16Y68vdK7nUgcoOOPzuXuFAD8SB8I281" target="_blank">no longer welcome to deliver a lecture there</a> for his suggestion that "Africans and Europeans did not share the same brain power." He told the <i>Sunday Times</i> that he was "inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa" because "all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours, whereas all the testing says not really." To deal with skeptists, he added: "people who have to deal with black employees find this not true."

To demonstrate his point, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,302836,00.html" target="_blank">he told a former student of his</a> that "he had recently inaugurated a DNA learning center near Harlem, and would like to have more black researchers at his lab", but "there's no one to recruit." He further argues in a book due to be published this week that his views are perfectly reasonable: "There is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically; our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so."

According to AP News, "this is not the first time Watson's speaking engagements have caused a stir":
<blockquote>In 2000 Watson shocked an audience at the University of California, Berkeley, when he advanced his theory about a link between skin color and sex drive. His lecture, complete with slides of bikini-clad women, argued that extracts of melanin — which give skin its color — had been found to boost subjects' sex drive. "That's why you have Latin lovers," he said, according to people who attended the lecture. "You've never heard of an English lover. Only an English patient."</blockquote>
Even before that, "Watson has long been something of a wild man":
<blockquote>In 1997, he told a British newspaper that a woman should have the right to abort her unborn child if tests could determine it would be homosexual. He later insisted he was talking about a "hypothetical" choice which could never be applied. He has claimed that beauty could be genetically manufactured, saying: "People say it would be terrible if we made all girls pretty. I think it would great."</blockquote>

Clearly, Watson is not the only Nobel Laureate who holds this view. According to Fox News, in the 1970s, "electronics pioneer William Shockley, who won the 1956 Nobel Prize in physics, said that the human race would suffer as less intelligent people outbred more intelligent ones, with the greatest damage to occur in the black American population."

The reaction to Watson's comments is, needless to say, belligerent. In a move intended to take away Watson's first-amendment rights, "<a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/sci_tech/article3067222.ece" target="_blank">anti-racism campaigners called for Dr Watson's remarks to be looked at in the context of racial hatred laws</a>." A spokesman for the 1990 Trust, a black human rights group, said: "it is astonishing that a man of such distinction should make comments that seem to perpetuate racism in this way. It amounts to fuelling bigotry and <i>we would like it to be looked at for grounds of legal complaint</i>." Now, that's just going too far.

What do you think? Does his voice merit some attention or are they just random babbles of a 79-year-old freak?
