It was some apparent wise man who quoted relationships as something that those who are on the outside want in, and those who are on the outside, want out.

That man was wrong in every way.

Relationships are never meant to be easy.  It is a consistent battle with one's personal feelings, one's struggles on a daily basis, and one's view of the world, among many other things.  After all, if a relationship was easy, why would so many of us bother to put our feelings out on the line?  What would be the worth, as such a concept would become equivalent to a one-night stand.

It's a worthy struggle, no matter how you put it.  With the pride and joy of a significant other, comes the sadness and sorrow.  With the struggle and war, there comes the agony of defeat, and yet that is offset by the pride of victory, and the elation that comes along with pulling through.  I am in my own struggle, but there is nothing better than being able to stand with that person, look at the world, and fight whatever comes your way.  The deeper one goes, the more wisdom is incurred.

The more worthy it becomes.
