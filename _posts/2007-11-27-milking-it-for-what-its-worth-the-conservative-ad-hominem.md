Consider the following:

- Conservatives are usually religious individuals (deeply, in fact) who take pride towards their devotion towards their church of choice, usually evangelical and towards that of God.

- Conservatives own the airwaves, with the likes of Michael Savage, Rush Limbaugh, et al, among others.  They also have a huge following in the media, with the likes of Ann Coulter, et al.

- Conservatives are anti-gay marriage, anti-abortion, and have been in favor of foreign policy that recommends military action in places such as Iraq, Iran and others.

Ann Coulter wrote a book demeaning 9/11 wives on their attention-whoring desires.  Michael Savage repeatedly insults the left wing on what they seem to lack.  Rush Limbaugh attacked actor Michael J. Fox in his ambition to get Parkinson's Disease recognized.  Coulter writes columns which continually demean Obama (calling him B. Hussein Obama to emphasize the fact that he shares a last name with the now deceased Saddam), describes liberals as Godless, and called John Edwards a "fag".

I'm no religious individual, but if God saw all this what would he think?  Would he approve of the bashing of Gays to the extreme, insulting wives who lost their husbands to a terror attack, demeaning of political individuals and those seeking a cure and the emphasis on the wrong things?  Would individuals like Coulter and Limbaugh, who claim to be more in tune with God, be welcomed into the gates of heaven, despite all the ad hominems they spew?

It's not to say that liberals are by any stretch of the imagination any better -- there are a few bad apples there too, but I don't think I've ever heard more ad hominems out of the conservative realm.  No wonder you can't take them seriously.
