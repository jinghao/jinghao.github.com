It is widely known that cows fart a lot. But how much that affects the rest of us, we were never sure. Of course, we all know that McDonald's business contributes more to global warming than ten Googles combined (ironically, Google's valued over three times more than McDonald's is).

Well, we know for a fact that "<a href="http://www.thedailygreen.com/2007/09/15/garlic-and-cow-flatulence-a-global-warming-cure/6698/" target="_blank">farm animals account for 16% of our planetâ€™s methane</a>", and that methane traps over eighteen times more heat than Carbon Dioxide does. Does that mean we should all go vegan? No. It means we should enforce sustainable herding and farming techniques that either trap the methane produced or causes farm animals to fart less. According to Popular Science, feeding cows garlic can reduce the "emissions" by fifty percent. That's not bad.

Have you heard of the excrement-collecting companies that harness the methane in them to turn the otherwise useless pile of organic waste into useful energy? I wonder how much crap-collectors get paid.
