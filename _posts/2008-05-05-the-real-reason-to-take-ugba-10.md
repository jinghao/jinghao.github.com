Because you'll make money in the short run and in the long run. In a market economy like this, business is how big money is made. But in the mean time while I am working toward my degrees, I made 35 dollars in my UGBA 10 class. Here's how.

The lecturer of the class's fifth module, professor Benjamin Hermalin, invited three volunteers to come up front as a part of an in-class demonstration of the risks involved in currency fluctuations. After a moment of silence during which nobody volunteered, I asked the pair in my immediate vicinity if they would join me, and they gladly did.

In the demonstration, we volunteers were given the following business scenario: We are a firm that imports European toys into the United States at 20 Euros each. However, we must pay for them later, subjecting us to fluctuations in the currency exchange market. The demand for our product is given by 50,000-1,000xP where P is the price per unit in dollars we offer the product for. We must choose how much to import and sell, knowing that the exchange rate could either be 1.50 dollars per Euro or 2.00 dollars per Euro (determined by a coin flip). The fun part is that the professor owed us 1 dollar for each 1,000 dollars in profit we make.

Although choosing the quantity corresponding to 42.5 dollars would have maximized expected value (the best option not knowing the outcome), I could not think with the level of lucidity that I would have preferred (while onstage), so I went for the second-best option, which is to bet all of my profits on the exchange rate remaining flat at 1.50 dollars per Euro. Needless to say, it worked out: we maximized our profits at 100,000 dollars. With a surprised look on his face, professor Hermalin took out his wallet and handed us 100 dollars from it, instructing us: "Don't spend it all at once."

Unfortunately, although my "teammates" did none of the calculus, I felt compelled to share my profits lest be called a douche bag by my professor onstage. I wish all my professors were as generous. After all, these 35 dollars (We obviously didn't split exactly 1/3 each) pay for a little more than three domains for this year. Dailycow.org, thank my professor.
