As a way of linking together two of Aristotle's most famous contributions to philosophy--his treatises on Ethics (friendship and love, for example) and on knowledge--I create the following:

Translation: the root of love (of the masculine kind) is testosterone (The reason I chose testosterone instead of estrogen, apart from the fact that I'm male, is that there is only one kind of testosterone whereas there are many kinds of estrogen). Yup. We can thank Intuition (the most important form of "knowing" according to Aristotle because of its role as the starting point for all other forms of knowing) for the first part and scientific knowledge (which is derived from intuition) for the latter part. Isn't philosophy great?

See, I'm studying :D Sort of. Okay, not really. But I learned what epistemology meant.
