My account has been disabled for unknown reasons (somehow breaking the Terms of Service) by a Facebook Administrator this afternoon and according to a Facebook engineer I IMed ("Boz"), my information (including my wall posts--dozens of hours of quirky creativity) is still there, just invisible, ready to be made visible by an administrator in his discretion. I've emailed disabled@facebook.com and hope to get a quick response from them. Meanwhile, I'll just be on AIM a bit more.

Of course, I don't have the slightest of ideas why I would get disabled. How I've breached the Terms of Service, I don't know, but I am told that "this is a security disable--you or someone who has your password was doing some bad stuff" (So which of you bastards has my password for Facebook, which is different from those of any of my other accounts, and fiddled around with my account?) and that "it is worth pointing out that you probably got disabled by software I (the engineer) wrote."

So if you notice that I don't respond on Facebook (I think it's rather difficult to contact me at this point, though), do try AIM or MSN or YIM. If I am in front of my computer, I am on AIM.
