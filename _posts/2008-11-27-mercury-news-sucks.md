What happened to its Fry's ads? Mercury News needs better "webmasters". (to call them software engineers would be too much of a bestowal of honor) When I try to click the link in the first screen shot (and every link I could find on Mercurynews.com to its Fry's ads), as you can see:

<a href="system/files/frys1.png"><img src="system/files/frys1s.png" /></a>

I'm taken to this random page for a supermarket I've never heard of:

<a href="system/files/frys2.png"><img src="system/files/frys2s.png" /></a>

WTF? I just want to find out what deals there are tomorrow. Before you answer, I've tried on multiple computers and multiple browsers--all to no avail. I conclude this is Mercury News's fault.

Mercury News, I don't question that you're losing market share. I also don't question that you're doing Fry's (as well as your whole reputation as a healthy newspaper to place ads) an extreme disservice. There's no wonder why my parents don't subscribe to you anymore.
