We both laugh at and feel sorry for them, but truly, how rare is the insanity that manifests itself in the form of homicide?
<blockquote><strong>Me:</strong> I'm curious about the incident in the Bible in which Abram's God asks him to sacrifice his only son. What do you make of that?
<strong>Friend:</strong> It was the one thing that he held most dear--perhaps even above God? And so by being willing to give that up, he put God as the top on his values.
<strong>Me:</strong> But if a voice from high up above asks you to sacrifice your twin brother, would you?
<strong>Friend:</strong> Yes.
<strong>Me:</strong> If you did, civic laws will deem you insane; if you didn't--well, you'd be disobeying that voice
<strong>Friend:</strong> Yes, I'd be seen as insane.</blockquote>
I'm glad I don't live near him anymore.
