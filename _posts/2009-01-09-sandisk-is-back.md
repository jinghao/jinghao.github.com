Four months ago, I described <a href="http://dailycow.org/node/363">what I believed SanDisk must do to regain its market leadership and profitability</a>: sell/cut its unprofitable memory chip division and focus on Solid State Drives (SSDs). Although it hasn't shown any progress on the former, it has done a remarkable job on the latter: it recently announced a series of SSDs that push them to the point of mass consumption.

The 60, 120 and 240 GB models in 1.8 inch and 2.5 inch form factors have MSRPs of $149, $249 and $499 (<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/storage/portable/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212701499">link</a>)--not that much more than standard magnetic hard drives (Keep in mind these are for laptops). But SSDs are silent, energy-efficient, reliable, and extremely fast. In fact, the data SanDisk provided really shocked me: The SSDs operate at <em>40,000</em> vRPMs (That is, if they were hard drives their equivalent speed would be 40,000 RPMs), making them <em>more than five times faster than the fastest laptop hard drives</em> (clocking in at 7,200 RPM). Amazingly, this is a 100% improvement on 2008 SSD models.

The best part? Since they are designed as drop-in replacements for laptop hard drives, you can buy one now and get rid of your clunky magnetic storage device.

So if you want a faster, quieter, more energy-efficient, reliable and rugged laptop with a significantly speedier boot-up, make sure your next purchase has a solid state drive in it. I certainly will. It will be worth the investment.
