[HECToR](http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSL1154155020080114?feedType=nl&feedName=ustechnology), the 113-million-pound machine that is Britain's "fastest computer and one of the most powerful in Europe" and can "make 63 million calculations each second," will be unveiled on Monday. Isn't that just funny? My computer can probably do 1-2 billion calculations each second. For something that has around 12,000 times the computational capacity of my laptop, I would have expected speeds of around 63 trillion calculations per second, which is probably the case. Instead, the article makes it seem as if the huge cluster struggles to process data even at sub-glacial speeds (And by that I'm referring to the speed of glaciers before Bush became president).
