There appears to be a <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/group.php?gid=27233634858" rel="external">Facebook group</a> for those who detest the new layout, which isn't terribly worse than before. People complain too much. And why isn't there a Facebook group for those who actually don't mind the new layout?

Oh yeah, that's the other 60 million people.
