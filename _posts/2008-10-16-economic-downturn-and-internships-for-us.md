Due to the economic uncertainty Google has scaled back spending growth to maintain its profit growth, enriching investors and management but hurting student-employees like us. In order to retain more of its revenue, it has scaled back hiring to a third of the level last year--meaning now my chances of getting hired by Google is 66% lower this year than it would have been last year.

Damn. I'm sure Google isn't the first to limit hiring.
