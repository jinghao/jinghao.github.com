No, not me. I'm talking about [Braden Eberle](http://origin.mercurynews.com/healthandscience/ci_8172204), a five-year-old who "swallowed two pencil-eraser-size magnets from a toy construction set." Curiously, (in a clearly mother-like fashion) his mother "didn't think it was a big deal" because she "never thought those little tiny magnets would still be there"; in stark contrast to his mother's nonchalant dismissal, Braden "needed immediate surgery because the magnets had pulled toward each other in his upper intestines and were pinching them."

The boy "will be featured on 'Good Morning America' today to highlight the dangers of powerful magnets now found in many children's toys." I'm curious what we can learn from the suicidal boy and his equally-defected mother: "I was an idiot. Don't eat magnets. They make your tummy hurt...and by the way, my mom's mean!"
