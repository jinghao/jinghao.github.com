Me: Mom, you have changed.
Mom: I didn't change, you grew up.

As young children, our naive and young minds always wander away from the things that matter in this world. When our parents get mad at us, for example, a lot of us are scared away, in thought that we are being wrongly treated. Is it wrong? No, not necessarily. As kids, we just never knew better.

My story always had to do with romance. Telling my parents about my crushes was the most difficult thing I could ever muster out of myself. After all, for parents who grew up in different eras, were introduced to each other, and have no idea what it means to be in Generation X, what advice are my parents going to give me besides what I already know?

I finally came out to my mother a week ago about these things. She seemed mildly amused at the prospect of all this, and very surprised. But in simplicity, she was supportive in the same way, a way that I never thought possible. Yes, not all of us are close with our mothers, but there is potential to change, and at 20, it feels like something has changed. Sitting down with her at Benson to lunch the other felt like I was meeting an old friend. The romantic bits are still a bit difficult to muster out, but nonetheless, things are definitely becoming easier.

The more I think about it, the more it feels like I was that rebellious teen. No cars were crashed, and no families were harmed in the process, but lots of secrets were held back. But when you think about it, family is your biggest asset. They are there to help you, guide you, treat you and help you on your way. They may tell you to not do certain things, but hardly are those things out of spite, but out of love and kindness towards their children. Imagine if your parents lost you: they would feel just as devastated as anything else.

I often wonder what life would be like if I was seven again. Often times now, I think that staying at that age would be a burden. The prospect of being a seven year old now escapes me. Twenty seems like an age I'd rather be at, but now so removed from the innocence, even that seems irrelevant within itself.

In this past week myself, I feel that I have grown up. The glass wall that seemed to separate my mother and I feel like its been shattered. Nothing more remains to be hidden. Nothing, because I took that change to grow up. You can too -- It just takes some simple courage.
