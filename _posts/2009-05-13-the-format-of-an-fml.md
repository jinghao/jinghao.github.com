_Today_, \[something happened\]. Then, _I realized_ that/_turns out_ \[what I said in the previous sentence is a lie\]/_I proceeded to_ \[do something extremely tragic\]. \[Fragment of WTF-ness\]. _FML_

Examples:

  _Today_, I woke up after a night of partying and went to the bathroom. That’s when _I realized that_ after passing out with my shoes on last night, my friends decided use a black sharpie and play “connect the dots” with my acne. _FML_

  _Today_, I finally beat the song "Through the Fire and Flames" on Guitar Hero 3. _I then realized that_ it was the biggest accomplishment I've ever made in my entire life. _FML_

  _Today_, I decided to shave my legs completely to be more confident in my dress. I spent over an hour making sure my legs were perfectly shaved. It wasn't until I had been out awhile that _I realized_ I forgot to shave my armpits. _FML_

  _Today_, the girl I like called me and said she liked me. After I told her I liked her too, she didn't say anything. Thinking the call was a joke, I started screaming at her and calling her a slut. _Turns out_ it wasn't a joke, she had just hit mute on her phone by accident. _FML_

  _Today_, I was walking to find a public toilet in a Chinese village. While looking for the women's restroom, I stepped on a thin sheet of plastic. _I proceeded to_ fall into the toilet's waste collection area and found myself knee-deep in the villagers' faeces. _FML_

... etc

They're all the same. I think FML stands for Formatted Markup Language.
