[Scientific American](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-origin-of-menopause) asks (and then answers) a strange question: "Why do women long outlive their fertility?" Wait, what? Are women only useful insofar as they are able to produce offsprings?

Oh, that's right. We need day care workers and babysitters too--you know, people to take care of the kids that they manufacture.

(If you didn't catch it, the tone was entirely ironical to mock the article)
