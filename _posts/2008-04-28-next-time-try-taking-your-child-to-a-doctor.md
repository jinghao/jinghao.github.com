Two parents, charging that their 11-year old daughter's diabetes were a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080429/ap_on_re_us/prayer_death">test of faith</a> are being charged for second degree reckless homicide.  The parents, both very religious and running Bible studies out of their coffee shop, are the latest in religious folk who believe that praying is the way to go and that doctor's aren't, because apparently, being ill is a sin, and asking for forgiveness is received with a cure.  

I'm glad my religious friends don't sink down to this kind of level.
