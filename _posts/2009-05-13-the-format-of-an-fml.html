<em>Today</em>, [something happened]. Then, <em>I realized</em> that/<em>turns out</em> [what I said in the previous sentence is a lie]/<em>I proceeded to</em> [do something extremely tragic]. [Fragment of WTF-ness]. <em>FML</em>

Examples:
<blockquote><em>Today</em>, I woke up after a night of partying and went to the bathroom. That’s when <em>I realized that</em> after passing out with my shoes on last night, my friends decided use a black sharpie and play “connect the dots” with my acne. <em>FML</em>

<em>Today</em>, I finally beat the song "Through the Fire and Flames" on Guitar Hero 3. <em>I then realized that</em> it was the biggest accomplishment I've ever made in my entire life. <em>FML</em>

<em>Today</em>, I decided to shave my legs completely to be more confident in my dress. I spent over an hour making sure my legs were perfectly shaved. It wasn't until I had been out awhile that <em>I realized</em> I forgot to shave my armpits. <em>FML</em>

<em>Today</em>, the girl I like called me and said she liked me. After I told her I liked her too, she didn't say anything. Thinking the call was a joke, I started screaming at her and calling her a slut. <em>Turns out</em> it wasn't a joke, she had just hit mute on her phone by accident. <em>FML</em>

<em>Today</em>, I was walking to find a public toilet in a Chinese village. While looking for the women's restroom, I stepped on a thin sheet of plastic. <em>I proceeded to</em> fall into the toilet's waste collection area and found myself knee-deep in the villagers' faeces. <em>FML</em></blockquote>

... etc

They're all the same. I think FML stands for Formatted Markup Language.
