In order to maintain a civil society, anarchy must be discouraged. People who destroy public property and otherwise flaunt the law in the name of "justice" need to be brought to justice. Hence, for the safety of all, the selfish lunatics who smashed in the windows of the North Berkeley BART station and graffitied over its walls must be taught to obey the law.

The anarchists will surrender themselves or be subject to abject punishment when they are found and caught. They will pay a fine equal to triple the the cost of repairing their damage. They will promise not to diverge violently from normal peaceful conduct. They will be law-abiding citizens.
