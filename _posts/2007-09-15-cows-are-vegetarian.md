Pretty self-explanatory, right? Well, explain that to Italy, especially to those who were recently affected by the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/italy/story/0,,2168508,00.html" target="_blank">"pasta shock"</a>.

According to economists, "the price of pasta is being driven by rising worldwide wheat prices." More specifically, the price increase is "the result of several trends - chiefly an increasing demand for biofuels, which can be made from it - and improved diets in emerging countries where putting more meat on the table is raising the demand for feed for livestock." Yup, that's right. You just can't have both more beef and cheaper pasta.

Funny thing is, I never see a deficit of pasta in UC Berkeley cafeterias, although I have been wondering where the beef has been. Screw chicken and pork--I want my beef!
