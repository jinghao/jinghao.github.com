So I have to read Plato's <i>Republic</i> for my Ancient Philosophy class, and I'm starting to get annoyed by Socrates. Before I took this class, I thought Socrates was some brilliant man who got unfairly prosecuted and sentenced to death for "corrupting the youth" and for "refusing to believe in the gods whom the city believes in". But now I know that he's just some annoying smartass who can't actually present arguments, but instead picks at the insignificant details, relying on stupid tricks to impress his audience.

Here's an example, from the first book of <i>The Republic</i>:
<blockquote><b>Thrasymachus:</b> I say justice is nothing other than what is advantageous for the stronger.
<b>Socrates:</b> First, I must understand what you mean. For, as things stand, I do not. What is advantageous for the stronger, you say, is just. What on earth do you mean, Thrasymachus? Surely you do not mean something like this: Polydamas, the pancratist, is stronger than we are. <i>Beef is advantageous for his body. So, this food is also both advantageous and just for us who are weaker than he?</i>
<b>Thrasymachus:</b> <i>You disgust me, Socrates. You interpret my account in the way that it does the most evil.</i>
<b>Socrates:</b> That's not it at all, my very good man; I only want you to make your meaning clearer.</blockquote>
I'm sick of Socrates distorting the meaning of others' words under the guise of stupidity to make them absolutely meaningless. Seriously, how can you conclude from the statement that "Justice is nothing other than what is advantageous for the stronger" that "Beef is just"?

So, does anyone else have any beef with Socrates?
