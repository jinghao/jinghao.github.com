When I got to Wheeler Auditorium at 9:03 ready to ace my UGBA 10 module two examination, I realized that I didn't have my scantron. Although I could have purchased another one from the Golden Bear Cafe (or the Student Store), I stupidly ran uphill to my apartment to retrieve the scantron and ran down back to Wheeler, fully aware of the professor's rules that prevent late-entry.

I never knew how fast I could run until today. Wow.
