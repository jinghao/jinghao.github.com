In the past couple years, several companies (Apple and Google for example) have put their executives (Jobs, Schmidt, Page and Brin) on one-dollar-a-year salaries and instead have compensated them with extremely generous stock option packages (Maybe not generous enough for Apple's Jobs since he backdates so much). But, apart from being just a marketing ploy, this is also a tax-minimization/income-maximization plan. Why? Because their fortunes are very strongly tied to the performance of their stocks.

Let's take a look at Google for instance: the three big bosses at Google (Schmidt, Page and Brin) collectively own a third of Google's shares, valuing them at over 60 billion dollars. But if we assume that their combined salaries totaled somewhere around 100 million dollars per year and that Google's forward price-to-earnings ratio remained at 40 (a conservative estimate), an increase in profit of 100 million dollars would translate to an increase in Google's market value by 4 billion dollars, of which the trio holds around $1.3 billion. Yup, you just saw 100 million dollars become 1.3 billion dollars, and the mechanism's not called fraud or trickery--I would call it a brilliant financial strategy.

But wait, the benefits don't just end there! Regular income (the 100 million) is subject to the 35% income tax but stock selling is only taxed at the 15% capital-gain rate. So in effect, Google's trio, through a very clever plan, exchanged 65 million dollars in after-tax income with 1.13 billion dollars in after-tax capital gain.

Isn't the financial market just great?
