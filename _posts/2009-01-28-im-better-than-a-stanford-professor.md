We all are! Or so my *Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems* professor hopes. Number six from our very first problem set involves finding an algorithm to compute the values in a matrix (I'll spare you the details) that is at least an order of magnitude more efficient than the one Stanford professor Evergreen proposed.

Yup. This class is awesome. Everyone should take it with me. Yes, that means you!
