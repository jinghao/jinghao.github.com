According to <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/health/article3033350.ece" target="_blank">researchers</a>, "the bird flu virus H5N1 has mutated into a form that makes it more infectious to humans, increasing the risk of a human pandemic." The lethal virus emerged in Asia in 2003 during the SARS scare, "leading to the slaughter of hundreds of millions of birds."

The reason for the increased likelihood of infection is simple: "Humans have a lower body temperature than birds and the avian virus finds it difficult to grow in the cooler conditions of the human throat. The mutated virus is better adapted to these cooler conditions, making transmission more likely."

Yet despite giving this issue all this publicity, Dr Kawaoka, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who led the research, asserted that he doesn't "like to scare the public, because they cannot do very much." Instead, scientists provide the public with comforting assurances that "<b>the risk is still high that it could evolve into a lethal strain that would kill on the scale of the 1914 pandemic when an estimated 40 million people died</b>." How comforting.

How are the various governments around the world dealing with this increased risk? Well, some countries such as Finland and Switzerland had placed "large orders" for the "newly developed vaccines against H5N1", but that "involved gambling on a human pandemic caused by the H5N1 strain happening in the next few years," Professor Angus Nicoll, the flu co-ordinator at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm, said.

On the other hand, other, more fiscally disciplined countries such as the UK have already predetermined precisely how they will efficiently and cheaply prepare for a possible pandemic; in contrast to the socialist pair, the UK "had ordered smaller amounts for<i> certain groups in the population</i>," because, clearly, that's how you prepare for the worst.

It's rather unfortunate that the natural human response to disease is to develop a fever, which would normally faciliate your body's virus-fighting campaigns, but not in this case because the H5N1 virus seems to like the heat. I guess if I get the avian flu and you have a fever from another ailment, and I cough and sneeze on you, you're almost guaranteed to contract the avian flu. Doesn't that suck?
