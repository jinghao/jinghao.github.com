According to <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa003&articleID=AFBC6A86-0ECD-2636-3D001626B7F793A9">Scientific American</a>, the "successful malaria vaccine" reduces malaria by 62%, and that's with individual vaccination. Imagine if everyone in Africa were vaccinated--after all, that's where vaccines derive their power. Malaria vaccines when effectively used in combination with less-scientific tools (mosquito nets and repellants, for example) can pretty much eliminate malaria in a generation.

With one of Africa's most destructive impediments gone, we can finally see whether Watson is right--whether their poverty is because of inherently African traits or because of uncontrollable outside forces.
