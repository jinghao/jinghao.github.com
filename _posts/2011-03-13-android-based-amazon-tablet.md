Amid the recent iPad 2 hype, the Wall Street Journal published an [article](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703662804576188901890884360.html) about the Nook Color (from Barnes and Nobles) running Google Android, contending that it provides just the right balance of features for $200, much cheaper the Motorola Xoom (also powered by Android).

This made me think: If B&N can find success in selling tablets that run Android, why can't Amazon, which has a much larger customer base and success with the Kindle? An Android-powered Kindle would be a significant boon to their business. They are working on their own [Appstore](http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/01/amazon-appstore-for-android-launching-this-month/). They have a huge selection of books. And they will be able to stream those premium movies to Prime members. 

It seems like the next logical step for Amazon to take to expand its reach. What do you think? If Amazon launched an Android tablet for under $300, I would be in line for one.
