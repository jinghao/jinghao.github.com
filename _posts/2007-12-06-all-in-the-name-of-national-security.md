According to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/07/washington/07intel.html" rel="external">NYT</a>, "the Central Intelligence Agency in 2005 destroyed at least two videotapes" that depicted their "subjecting terrorism suspects — including Abu Zubaydah, the first detainee in C.I.A. custody — to severe interrogation techniques, a step it took in the midst of Congressional and legal scrutiny about its secret detention program" because "officers were concerned that video showing harsh interrogation methods could expose agency officials to legal risks" and because "they no longer had intelligence value." Talk about government transparency. Isn't it great to live in a free democratic country that protects you as well as it can?
