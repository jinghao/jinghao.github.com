Google, is amazing.  I found [this](http://www.bigzaphod.org/cow/) website on COW, a programming language that has been around since 2003.  It seems like a parody, more than anything else.  I found this on their website, describing what it is.

<blockquote>The COW programming language was designed with the bovine in mind. Given that cows have somewhat limited vocabulary skills, it seemed natural to incorporate only the words they know into the language. As a result, all instructions are some variation on "moo" which just so happens to be the only word they really understand. </blockquote>

More or less, this is a play on the word "moo", apparently the only word they know.  You can get a C++ source on this (link is at the bottom)  I'm not sure I get it, but if you care, you can go take a look.  I'm sure Jinghao will be enthused.

On a completely different subject, what constitutes professionalism?  The Chinese Student's Association's (CSA) secretary loads her emails with Asian smileys.  Here is a tidbit:

<blockquote>Come and see what the fuss is all about at the next CSA general meeting on Monday 10/15/07 at 5:30 PM in Shapell. ^^ At the meeting we'll...
 
- perform a continuation of the shuai ge/ la mei saga  ^____^ (part 1 of our entertainment) 
 
- Have our elections for freshman rep and historian (part 2 of our entertainment as some candidates are making videos) ^_^ Good luck, everybody!!! 
 
- talk about our next upcoming event: KARAOKE! ^_____^ $2 for members/ $5 non-members. If you want to eat dinner with us at King's Noodle (Note: Dinner is NOT INCLUDED in the $2/$5 karaoke prices), meet us in Shapell at 6 PM. Otherwise, karaoke starts at 8 PM. 
 
- lastly, announce a special joint event with VSA [Vietnamese Student Assocation] that we'll have before karaoke (omg, two events!? in one week!? O_O) 
</blockquote>

When I was secretary of CSA last year, I never used smileys because I believed that as a club (no matter how much fun you put into it), you leave out smileys because it makes you and your club less credible.  Smileys to me are supposed to be used in personal emails only.  What do you guys think?
