The title probably makes little sense, but for the sports fan, it makes perfect sense.  Even if you don't follow the day-to-day events in the National Football League (NFL) or Major League Baseball (MLB), consider the following pieces of evidence when I conclude that there is little or not much justice at all when it comes to America's so-called judicial system.

* Michael Vick, former NFL quarterback and now in jail on dogfighting charges.  Whether he is innocent or guilty in the end, you must consider the fact that before even being booked on these charges, organizations such as the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) as well as NFL players demonstrated by either protesting in front of the Atlanta Falcons sports complex or by making a public statement in favor of dogs.  If we so believe that "innocent before guilty" is true, then why are we jumping to conclusions?  Yes, Vick has had marijuana issues, and that may make it more likely that he may have engaged in dogfighting, but that in no way means that he actually did it.

* Barry Bonds, current left fielder for the San Francisco Giants, hit 73 home runs in 2001 and has hit 762 for his career, breaking the all-time home run record.  He has been suspected of taking performance enhancing drugs somewhere between the end of the 1999 season and the beginning of the 2000 season.  Evidence of his hat size increasing, muscles getting bigger and temper worsening are good concrete examples of him using steroids, but it has never been proven that Bonds has taken steroids.  Yet despite this, people continue to rag on him, and Mark Ecko, entertainment star and winner of the Bonds auction, decides that he will stick an asterisk on the ball before sending it off to the hall.  Sure, it's the by-product of an already flawed capitalist society, but the fact that Bonds has yet to have his day in court, or even be convicted of having steroids means that he is still innocent until proven guilty.

* The detainees at Guantanamo Bay are also denied their right to a speedy trial, as well as access to attorneys.  They are suspected terrorists, but there have been no pieces of evidence suggesting that they are terrorists.  They get the best health care on US soil (according to filmmaker Michael Moore anyway in the movie <i>Sicko</i>.), and rights to their holy books, but when it comes to justice, they get very little.

While these are two highly-paid stars, and a group of suspected terrorists, one of whom own luxuries beyond our wildest dreams and make money more than we would ever make, and the others suspected of blowing up this country, the simple argument would be to just leave them alone and let them get heckled, because hey, they do make tons of money or want to kill us, right?  Wrong.  The simple fact of the matter is that these are two highly publicized examples of a greater epidemic seen by many in the United States.  The epidemic of jumping to conclusions before they are actually reached.  How many innocent individuals die at the hands of the death penalty every year?  How many innocent folks are sent to jail each year on the basis of information that is both flawed, out of date, and in many cases, biased?  The answer is too many.  

It really makes you wonder if the justice system is there to complete the task of justice, which is what the Magna Carta laid out in 1215, or whether the justice system is there to complete an act of revenge, kind of as a substitute to a sword fight, as many would have done 400-600 years ago.

It also makes you wonder what they teach in High School Civics these days.
