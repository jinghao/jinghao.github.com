To complement the March 2005 Anti-Secession Law, Chinese President Hu Jintao should issue the Chinese analog of the Monroe Doctrine: that foreign powers may no longer interfere with the internal affairs of China. What about the analog of the Roosevelt Corollary? China will interfere on behalf of foreign powers to maintain economic and political stability in its regions of influence.

... not that other countries should have any influence over the internal affairs of China--this is just to cement that fact as law. So don't f- with us and stop selling Taiwan 17th century arms and planes.
