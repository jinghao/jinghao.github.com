Actually, energy investors pushed the [price of crude to $84 for the first time](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7040775.stm) to mock [Al Gore and his Nobel Peace Prize](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7042423.stm) for his global warming activism. Ha, ha, funny. Now stop manipulating the price of oil.
