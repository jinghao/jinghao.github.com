Why are the most efficient hybrids (Toyota Prius and Honda Insight) hatchbacks? And why do [entrants to the electric vehicle arena](http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-GreenBusiness/idUSTRE5710IH20090802) emulate that design? Are they all trying to appear "different" like a Prius?

If I want a hybrid, I want it for the fuel-saving feature, not to let everybody know what a great environmentalist I am, so I'd want something that's still designed with airflow and the human eye in mind.

I'm glad Tesla has started in that direction.
