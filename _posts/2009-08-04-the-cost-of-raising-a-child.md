The [government estimated](http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE57367220090804) that it costs middle-class families 292k to raise a child to adulthood in 2008, accounting for inflation. I don't think that includes all the opportunity costs--time spent babysitting, the opportunity cost of money, etc. That said, the entire cost probably comes closer to a million.

So why do poor people have more kids? Would they be if they weren't financially rewarded for it?
