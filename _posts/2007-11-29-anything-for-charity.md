Maria Carolina, a Chilean prostitute, has <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=oddlyEnoughNews&storyid=2007-11-29T172206Z_01_EIC874235_RTRUKOC_0_US-PROSTITUTE1.xml" rel="external">"already auctioned off the 27 hours of love"</a> in order to "raise money for the country's largest charity during an annual fund-raising campaign [which] aims to raise funds for poor, disabled children." So far, "she had raised about $4,000"; one of her clients "already paid" because "it seemed like a good deed to him." Anyone want to help out for a good cause?
