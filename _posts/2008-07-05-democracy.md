The great thing about democracy is that when something is wrong, it's the fault of the current administration--the people in power--not the country or those who inhabit it. (For example, the political silencing during the Tiananmen Square incident is China's fault because China is a bad country while the unilateral invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan and the illegal spying on civilians are just part of Bush's game)

It's a shame that many who tout democracy yet denounce Bush forget that those who inhabit this country are also the electorate. So it is our fault that Bush is in power.
