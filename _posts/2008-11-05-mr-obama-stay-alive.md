In his endorsement speech, Senator Ted Kennedy compared now-President-elect Barack Obama to his assassinated brother John F. Kennedy. With the worrying levels of resentment by many regarding his race and meteoric rise in national politics, I fear that he may be the third political-revolutionary in the Oval Office to get assassinated, after Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy.

That possibility doesn't seem as far-fetched as one may think.
