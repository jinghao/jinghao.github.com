I was considering investment banking as a post-graduation career. After all, I would be equipped with all the technical knowledge Berkeley's EECS department offered and all the business basics Haas taught.

But 16 hours a day average starting at 4:30 AM is a bit excessive. What if I want a life?

And you may think that they get paid a lot--but 60k base + bonus is nothing compared to what any regular EECS major may make at Google, Intel, IBM, whatever--in years like these when bonus basically means zero.

Bye bye, investment banking; hello, life!
