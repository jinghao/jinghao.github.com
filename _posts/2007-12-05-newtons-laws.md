So my philosophy professor was lecturing on Aristotle's cosmology and physics when he said that Aristotle believed that everything in the universe had its natural place (Earth wants to be at the center of the universe, water second, air third, fire fourth, and "quintessence" last) and that Aristotle's explanations sufficed for the two millennia until Newton came about. Professor Macfarlane got into trouble when he tried to explain the Newtonian interpretation of the universe.

He drew two spherical bodies, the Earth and the Moon, and said that Newtonian mechanics says that both objects exert forces on each other--the force that keeps them together in an elliptical (or circular, simplistically) orbit. So where's the trouble? When the professor drew arrows representing forces and said that the arrow coming out of the Moon is smaller than the one out of the Earth.

Equal and opposite reaction--what happened to that?
