I took the time today to look up the description of this landmark on Shattuck that I walk by almost every week near the Berkeley BART station. I found it quite interesting:

Earth Song, 2003
Downtown Shattuck Ave. Public Art, Berkeley, CA. Commissioned by the Berkeley Arts and Cultural Commission.

A 45 foot Tuning Fork sculpture is tuned to the 16ths octave pitch to Earths fundamental natural frequency period, done with the help of seismic engineers. The Sculpture itself will be constantly set to vibrate by the chaotic mechanical energy from the wind and traffic while translating it into the Earths free oscillation pitch. At 3'6" high, a part of the sculpture is designed to invite pedestrians to sample the sound of the pitch, by knocking at it.
