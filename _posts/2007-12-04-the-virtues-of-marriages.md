Marriage is good because <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/GMA/WaterCooler/story?id=3951160" rel="external">the ring can save you from a gunshot</a> and because it is <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071203190625.htm" rel="external">green.</a> That's right, ladies and gentlemen--share beds and bedrooms to help the world and you.

It might be a good conversation-starter too:
<strong>You</strong>: "Do you believe in preventing or reversing global warming?"
<strong>Girl</strong> (or boy, if you prefer): "Yeah. Of course. Why not?"
<strong>You</strong>: "Cool. Then stop being single. We can save energy and the world together."

EDIT: Or alternatively, as some of my insightful (cough) friends have pointed out, you can just...get a ring (without being married) or share a bed (without being married).
