<i>The eyes are not here
There are no eyes here
In this valley of dying stars
In this hollow valley
This broken jaw of our lost kingdom
</i>

T.S. Eliot is so much more depressing when you're reading him outside of class. Must resonate more with me now. Not that I like emo poetry or anything. >.>

Anyhow...Waste Valley...that's what the locals call it here at West Valley Community College. No, it's not because there are many international students who can't pronounce 'west' --those students go to De Anza. It's because everyone gets wasted before coming to class. What else can explain the lack of academic inclination? Just kidding, I think the name comes from those who would rather be working than wasting their time with boring classes. But that's not to say that there isn't a fair share of people who come to class looking pretty stoned. So I don't exactly feel like I fit in here. But I think I'm moving on to Acceptance. While we're on the subject, here's my past several months on the Kubler-Ross model.

Denial: No...I did <i>not</i> get spring admissions to Berkeley. It must've been a mistake.
Anger: Why me!? What's this supposed to mean? You calling me less competent than your other applicants? Well I'll show you! I'm going to UCLA!
Bargaining: But I don't <i>want</i> to go to LA. Appeal! Appeal! Did you know that I'm actually black?
Depression: Everyone's going off to college and I'm still stuck here. *sob*
Acceptance: On the bright side, West Valley has nice...shrubbery.


But that's not the point. The point is, it's October 1st, which means...first semester is more than a third over with! Then I can be an official cow...er I mean Cal student in 10 weeks. Go Bears! Wouldn't it be cool if Cal changed its mascot to a cow? Then we could be the Cal Cows. And if the football team lived up to their name, they'd just be massive vegetarians waiting to be Cow-tipped on the field. I'd totally have school spirit.
