What does it tell you when we live in a nation that <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071107/ap_on_el_ge/eln_ballot_measures">rejects important scientific advances</a>, and decide to forbid students from <a href="http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Quirks/2007/11/06/student_punished_for_hugging_friends/9972/">hugging</a> each other.  I mean honestly, don't we have more important things to worry about like terrorism, school grades and getting into high school?
