According to a friend who works at Apple, the company emailed its employees notifying them of their ex-CEO's (temporary, hopefully) departure at around 1:30 PM Pacific time. Then just a minute or two later (at 1:32 PM PDT), a huge sale of 19.21 million dollars of Apple stock went through, creating an extremely aberrant spike in the after-market activity. Then at 2:00 PM, the announcement went public and the stock took an expected 10% nosedive.

The 19.21 million dollar sale is 15 times larger than the next largest sale of Apple shares in today's after-market and came at the most suspicious time: just a couple minutes after the email was sent out, just enough time for someone to call a wealthy friend and for that friend to log onto Scottrade to dump all his Apple shares.

Behaviors like these are despicable and must be condemned. Those involved in the insider trading scheme must be made public, fired from their jobs, have their credentials questioned (Does it matter if you graduated from Harvard if you're as dishonest and selfish as the rest of them?), prosecuted, and sent to jail.

It's a shame that someone would attempt to profit off of the ex-CEO's ailing health. Let's hope for a just resolution to this offense to investor confidence.
