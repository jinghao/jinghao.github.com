I was stumbling today and to my great surprise I stumbled upon (ha) something mathematical: http://www.kirix.com/blog/2008/07/22/fun-and-fraud-detection-with-benfords-law/

After reading the page, I realized that by "natural" the author means logarithmic statistics, such as population and other things whose changes are measured in percents (say, stock prices, GDP values, inflation). Wow, Benford, what a great way to take something that's so obvious and make it sound so strange.

Disclaimer: That's just what I hypothesize is the cause. The page did not explain why this is the case for certain datasets.
