I buy things that I perceive to be cheaper than what I think they are worth in the market. That's why I buy electronics that I rarely use. At times it's a curse.

When the solar stock I've been trading fell to 37 a share, I felt that it was sufficiently cheap enough to purchase, so I bought it and watched it race up to well over 42 dollars a share. Instead of selling it (since I believed its intrinsic value is somewhere around the mid 40s), I held it.

Now it's 28, but I don't have any money to get any more. I hate curses.
