The dividend ex-date for [FRO](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:FRO) is today, meaning you must have bought the stock before today in order to get the dividend, which is three dollars per share.

The stock fell six dollars per share. I hope people are having fun with the three dollar per share loss.
